To produce hemoglobin and red blood cells, the body needs iron, vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from the foods one eat. Without adequate iron, the body can't produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells. Besides iron, the body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood cells. This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when the body doesn't produce enough red blood cells. A variety of diseases, such as leukemia and myelofibrosis, can cause anemia by affecting blood production in the bone marrow. This group of anemias develops when red blood cells are destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them.","If one has cancer, kidney failure, diabetes or another chronic condition, one could be at risk of anemia of chronic disease. Slow, chronic blood loss from an ulcer or other source within the body can deplete the body's store of iron, leading to iron deficiency anemia. A diet consistently low in iron, vitamin B-12 and folate increases the risk of anemia. In general, women who haven't had menopause have a greater risk of iron deficiency anemia than do men and postmenopausal women. If one is pregnant and aren't taking a multivitamin with folic acid and iron, one is at an increased risk of anemia. If the family has a history of an inherited anemia, such as sickle cell anemia, one also might be at increased risk of the condition. A history of certain infections, blood diseases and autoimmune disorders increases the risk of anemia. Alcoholism, exposure to toxic chemicals, and the use of some medications can affect red blood cell production and lead to anemia.","To diagnose anemia, the doctor is likely to ask one about the medical and family history, perform a physical exam, and run the following tests: Complete blood count (CBC). For anemia, the doctor will be interested in the levels of the red blood cells contained in the blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in the blood.","Managing hemolytic anemias includes avoiding suspect medications, treating infections and taking drugs that suppress the immune system, which could be attacking the red blood cells.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the major vessel that supplies blood to the body (aorta).,"Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta, but most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of the aorta that's in the abdomen. A number of factors can play a role in developing an aortic aneurysm, including Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Rarely, a bacterial or fungal infection might cause an abdominal aortic aneurysms.","Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include Tobacco use. It can weaken the aortic walls, increasing the risk not only of developing an aortic aneurysm, but of rupture. Men develop abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do. People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition. Having an aneurysm in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee or the aorta in the chest, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.","Abdominal aortic aneurysms are often found during an examination for another reason or during routine medical tests, such as an ultrasound of the heart or abdomen. To diagnose an abdominal aortic aneurysm, doctors will review the medical and family history and do a physical exam. Screening recommendations vary, but in general: There isn't enough evidence to determine whether women ages 65 to 75 who ever smoked cigarettes or have a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm would benefit from abdominal aortic aneurysm screening.

Angina pectoris,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373,"Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort, possibly described as pressure, squeezing, burning or fullness. For example, pain that comes on when one is walking uphill or in the cold weather may be angina. New or different symptoms may signal a more dangerous form of angina (unstable angina) or a heart attack. There's another type of angina, called variant angina or Prinzmetal's angina. For example, chest pain is a common symptom in women with angina, but it may not be the only symptom or the most prevalent symptom for women. If one has been diagnosed with stable angina and it gets worse or changes, seek medical attention immediately.",,"Angina is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. The most common cause of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is coronary artery disease (CAD). If fatty deposits (plaques) in a blood vessel rupture or a blood clot forms, it can quickly block or reduce flow through a narrowed artery. Unstable angina can also be caused by blood clots that block or partially block the heart's blood vessels. If the blood flow doesn't improve, the heart is starved of oxygen and a heart attack occurs. When one climb stairs, exercise or walk, the heart demands more blood, but narrowed arteries slow down blood flow. Besides physical activity, other factors such as emotional stress, cold temperatures, heavy meals and smoking also can narrow arteries and trigger angina. This narrowing reduces blood flow to the heart, causing severe chest pain. Emotional stress, smoking, medications that tighten blood vessels (such as some migraine drugs) and use of the illegal drug cocaine may trigger Prinzmetal's angina.","Chewing tobacco, smoking and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke damage the interior walls of arteries including arteries to the heart allowing deposits of cholesterol to collect and block blood flow. Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease, which leads to angina and heart attacks by speeding up atherosclerosis and increasing the cholesterol levels. A high level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as bad cholesterol, increases the risk of angina and heart attacks. If a family member has coronary artery disease or has had a heart attack, one is at a greater risk of developing angina. An inactive lifestyle contributes to high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Obesity is linked with high blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes, all which increase the risk of angina and heart disease.","A nuclear stress test helps measure blood flow to the heart muscle at rest and during stress. During coronary angiography, a type of dye that's visible by X-ray machine is injected into the blood vessels of the heart. The X-ray machine rapidly takes a series of images (angiograms), offering a detailed look at the inside of the blood vessels. The doctor can use these images to identify angina-related problems, including heart muscle damage due to poor blood flow. An echocardiogram can be given during a stress test, and this can show if there are areas of the heart that are not getting enough blood. An X-ray tube inside the machine rotates around the body and collects images of the heart and chest, which can show if any of the heart's arteries are narrowed or if the heart is enlarged. In a cardiac MRI, one lie on a table inside a long, tubelike machine that produces detailed images of the heart's structure and its blood vessels.",,"Because heart disease is often the cause of angina, one can reduce or prevent angina by working on reducing the heart disease risk factors. Treat diseases or conditions that can increase the risk of angina, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol.","But medical procedures such as angioplasty, stenting and coronary artery bypass surgery may also be used to treat angina. This procedure improves blood flow in the heart, reducing or eliminating angina. Angioplasty and stenting is a good treatment option if one has unstable angina or if lifestyle changes and medications don't effectively treat the chronic, stable angina. Nitrates relax and widen the blood vessels, allowing more blood to flow to the heart muscle. Aspirin reduces the ability of the blood to clot, making it easier for blood to flow through narrowed heart arteries. Certain medications such as clopidogrel (Plavix), prasugrel (Effient) and ticagrelor (Brilinta) can help prevent blood clots from forming by making the blood platelets less likely to stick together. Beta blockers also help blood vessels relax and open up to improve blood flow, thus reducing or preventing angina. They may also help the body reabsorb cholesterol that has accumulated in plaques in the artery walls, helping prevent further blockage in the blood vessels. Calcium channel blockers, also called calcium antagonists, relax and widen blood vessels by affecting the muscle cells in the arterial walls. This increases blood flow in the heart, reducing or preventing angina. Ranexa can be used alone or with other angina medications, such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers or nitroglycerin. With ECP, blood pressure-type cuffs are placed around the calves, thighs and pelvis to increase blood flow to the heart.",Cardiology,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/A_man_having_a_Heart_Attack.png

Many conditions can cause ataxia, including alcohol misuse, certain medication, stroke, tumor, cerebral palsy, brain degeneration and multiple sclerosis.","Damage, degeneration or loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain that controls muscle coordination (cerebellum), results in ataxia. For some adults who develop sporadic ataxia, no specific cause can be found. Sporadic ataxia can take a number of forms, including multiple system atrophy, a progressive, degenerative disorder. The abnormal proteins hamper the function of nerve cells, primarily in the cerebellum and spinal cord, and cause them to degenerate. In the latter case, it's possible neither parent has the disorder (silent mutation), so there might be no obvious family history. Different gene defects cause different types of ataxia, most of which are progressive. In an autosomal dominant disorder, the abnormal gene is a dominant gene located on one of the nonsex chromosomes (autosomes). There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive EA1 through EA7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. One might have dizziness (vertigo), fatigue and muscle weakness during the episodes. Episodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms might respond to medication. This common hereditary ataxia involves damage to the cerebellum, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. This rare, progressive childhood disease causes degeneration in the brain and other body systems. The disease also causes immune system breakdown (immunodeficiency disease), which increases susceptibility to other diseases, including infections and tumors. Children with ataxia-telangiectasia are at high risk of developing cancer, particularly leukemia or lymphoma. Most people with the disease need a wheelchair by their teens and die before age 30, usually of cancer or lung (pulmonary) disease. Multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, celiac disease and other autoimmune conditions can cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign), can damage the cerebellum. Not getting enough of these nutrients, because of the inability to absorb enough, alcohol misuse or other reasons, can lead to ataxia. This infection may cause ataxia, most commonly in very severe cases. Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow.

With this type of atrial fibrillation, the heart rhythm doesn't go back to normal on its own. If one has persistent atrial fibrillation, one will need treatment such as an electrical shock or medications in order to restore the heart rhythm. In this type of atrial fibrillation, the abnormal heart rhythm can't be restored. One will have atrial fibrillation permanently, and one will often require medications to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.",,"In atrial fibrillation, electrical signals fire from multiple locations in the atria (typically pulmonary veins), causing them to beat chaotically. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that occurs when the two upper chambers of the heart experience chaotic electrical signals. In atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation, but the rhythm in the atria is more organized and less chaotic than the abnormal patterns common with atrial fibrillation.","The older one is, the greater the risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Anyone with heart disease such as heart valve problems, congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, or a history of heart attack or heart surgery has an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Having high blood pressure, especially if it's not well-controlled with lifestyle changes or medications, can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. People with certain chronic conditions such as thyroid problems, sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, chronic kidney disease or lung disease have an increased risk of atrial fibrillation.","To diagnose atrial fibrillation, the doctor may review the signs and symptoms, review the medical history, and conduct a physical examination. The doctor may order several tests to diagnose the condition, including Electrocardiogram (ECG). It records the heart's activity for 24 hours or longer, which provides the doctor with a prolonged look at the heart rhythms.

Autism spectrum disorder includes conditions that were previously considered separate autism, Asperger's syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and an unspecified form of pervasive developmental disorder.","Despite extensive research, no reliable study has shown a link between autism spectrum disorder and any vaccines. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder.","Autism spectrum disorder affects children of all races and nationalities, but certain factors increase a child's risk. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder.

Back pain that lasts more than three months (chronic) is less common than acute pain. Back pain often develops without a cause that the doctor can identify with a test or an imaging study. Conditions commonly linked to back pain include Muscle or ligament strain. If one is in poor physical condition, constant strain on the back can cause painful muscle spasms. However, one can have a bulging or ruptured disk without back pain.

These factors might put one at greater risk of developing back pain: Age. Back pain is more common as one get older, starting around age 30 or 40. Weak, unused muscles in the back and abdomen might lead to back pain. People prone to depression and anxiety appear to have a greater risk of back pain. This reduces blood flow to the lower spine, which can keep the body from delivering enough nutrients to the disks in the back.","If there is reason to suspect that a specific condition is causing the back pain, the doctor might order one or more tests: X-ray. These images alone won't show problems with the spinal cord, muscles, nerves or disks. These scans generate images that can reveal herniated disks or problems with bones, muscles, tissue, tendons, nerves, ligaments and blood vessels. In rare cases, the doctor might use a bone scan to look for bone tumors or compression fractures caused by osteoporosis.",,,"Depending on the type of back pain one has, the doctor might recommend the following: There's no commonly accepted program to teach people with back pain how to manage the condition effectively. A physical therapist can apply a variety of treatments, such as heat, ultrasound, electrical stimulation and muscle-release techniques, to the back muscles and soft tissues to reduce pain. As pain improves, the therapist can teach one exercises to increase the flexibility, strengthen the back and abdominal muscles, and improve the posture. If one has unrelenting pain associated with radiating leg pain or progressive muscle weakness caused by nerve compression, one might benefit from surgery. Otherwise, surgery usually is reserved for pain related to structural problems, such as narrowing of the spine (spinal stenosis) or a herniated disk, that hasn't responded to other therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), might relieve acute back pain. If OTC pain relievers don't relieve the pain, the doctor might suggest prescription NSAIDs. If mild to moderate back pain doesn't improve with OTC pain relievers, the doctor might also prescribe a muscle relaxant. Low doses of certain types of antidepressants particularly tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline have been shown to relieve some types of chronic back pain independent of their effect on depression.

The most common benign peripheral nerve tumor in adults, a schwannoma, can occur anywhere. Some schwannomas may enlarge and assume unusual shapes within the spine or pelvis, such as dumbbell tumors. If one has a rare schwannoma near the brainstem (an acoustic neuroma), one may notice trouble with the balance or hearing. Also known as a vestibular schwannoma, most of the time this type of tumor forms without being associated with a syndrome, but a few acoustic neuromas may be diagnosed as neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumors. Schwannomas most commonly occur as solitary tumors, though occasionally individuals may have several of them in the arms, legs or body, a condition known as schwannomatosis.

When one has a blocked tear duct, the tears can't drain normally, leaving one with a watery, irritated eye.","Tears drain into the puncta, located in the inside corners of the upper and lower eyelids. The eyelids have small canals (canaliculi) that move tears to a sac where the lids are attached to the side of the nose (lacrimal sac). From there tears travel down a duct (the nasolacrimal duct) draining into the nose. A blockage can occur at any point in the tear drainage system, from the puncta to the nose. When that happens, the tears don't drain properly, giving one watery eyes and increasing the risk of eye infections and inflammation. As one age, the tiny openings that drain tears (puncta) may get narrower, causing blockage. Chronic infection or inflammation of the eyes, tear drainage system or nose can cause the tear ducts to become blocked. An injury to the face can cause bone damage or scarring near the drainage system, disrupting the normal flow of tears through the ducts. Disorders that cause swelling, such as sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, can increase the risk of developing a blocked tear duct. Rarely, long-term use of certain medications, such as eyedrops used to treat glaucoma, can cause a blocked tear duct.","If the eyes are continually irritated, red and inflamed (conjunctivitis), one is at higher risk of developing a blocked tear duct.

These medications can strengthen bones and reduce the pain caused by bone metastasis, reducing the need for strong pain medications. Oral forms of these medications are available, but they generally aren't as effective as the IV or injectable forms, and may cause digestive tract side effects. Pain medications may control the pain caused by bone metastasis. Medications known as steroids can often help to relieve pain associated with bone metastases by decreasing swelling and inflammation around the sites of cancer. Steroids can work quite quickly to help pain and prevent some cancer complications, but they also must be used very cautiously because they have side effects, especially when used for prolonged periods. Radiation therapy may be an option if the bone metastasis is causing pain that isn't controlled with pain medications or if the pain is confined to a small number of areas. If bone metastasis has caused a bone to break, surgeons may work to repair the bone. In general, broken bones caused by bone metastasis aren't helped by placing a cast on the broken bone. Side effects can include damage to nearby structures, such as nerves, and damage to bones that can increase the risk of a broken bone. If cancer has spread to multiple bones, the doctor may recommend chemotherapy. For cancers that are sensitive to chemotherapy, chemotherapy may be the best way to alleviate pain from bone metastases. If the bone is in danger of breaking due to bone metastasis, surgeons can stabilize the bone using metal plates, screws and nails (orthopedic fixation).

Gene mutations can occur for several reasons, for instance: Gene mutations occur frequently during normal cell growth. The gene mutations one is born with and those that one acquire throughout the life work together to cause cancer. For instance, if one has inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes one to cancer, that doesn't mean one is certain to get cancer. Instead, one may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. Cancer cells lose the controls (tumor suppressor genes) that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating. A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren't corrected, leading cells to become cancerous.","While doctors have an idea of what may increase the risk of cancer, the majority of cancers occur in people who don't have any known risk factors. Smoking, drinking more than one alcoholic drink a day (for women of all ages and men older than age 65) or two drinks a day (for men age 65 and younger), excessive exposure to the sun or frequent blistering sunburns, being obese, and having unsafe sex can contribute to cancer.

A lot of time spent in the sun or in commercial tanning beds increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma. Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma at previous treatment sites on the skin. The risk of basal cell carcinoma is higher among people who freckle or burn easily or who have very light skin, red or blond hair, or light-colored eyes. Because basal cell carcinoma often takes decades to develop, the majority of basal cell carcinomas occur in older adults.

To confirm that the symptoms are caused by cancer, the doctor may recommend a procedure to remove a sample of cells for lab testing (biopsy). Blood tests that measure the organ function can give the doctor clues about whether cancer might be affecting the organs, such as the kidneys and liver. Blood tests that look for molecules that are sometimes produced by certain types of cancer (tumor markers) might provide more information for the diagnosis. Doctors who specialize in analyzing blood and body tissue (pathologists) might run more-thorough tests of the cancer cells to gather more information for the diagnosis. Pathologists might use high-tech microscopes, special dyes and other technology, such as tests to look for changes in the genes and chromosomes of the cancer cells DNA.","To determine which treatments might be best for one, the doctor will consider where the cancer cells were found, which type of normal cells they most closely resemble and the results of lab tests. The concern and understanding of a counselor, medical social worker, clergy member or cancer support group also may be helpful. If the doctor suspects that one might have cancer, one may be referred to a doctor who specializes in caring for people with cancer (oncologist). One or more chemotherapy drugs may be given through a vein in the arm (intravenously), taken orally, or administered with both methods. An operation to cut away the cancer might be an option if the carcinoma of unknown primary is limited to one area, such as a lymph node or the liver.

Cholera,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholera/symptoms-causes/syc-20355287,"But because they shed cholera bacteria in their stool for seven to 14 days, they can still infect others through contaminated water. Most cases of cholera that cause symptoms cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to tell apart from diarrhea caused by other problems. Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. If one develop severe diarrhea after visiting an area with active cholera, see the doctor. If one has diarrhea, especially severe diarrhea, and think one might have been exposed to cholera, seek treatment right away. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed.","Cholera is a bacterial disease usually spread through contaminated water. The risk of a cholera epidemic is highest when poverty, war or natural disasters force people to live in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation.","The toxin causes the body to secrete enormous amounts of water, leading to diarrhea and a rapid loss of fluids and salts (electrolytes). Eating raw or undercooked seafood, especially shellfish, that comes from certain places can expose one to cholera bacteria. Raw, unpeeled fruits and vegetables are a frequent source of cholera infection in areas where there's cholera. In developing countries, uncomposted manure fertilizers or irrigation water containing raw sewage can contaminate produce in the field.","Cholera bacteria can't survive in an acidic environment, and ordinary stomach acid often serves as a defense against infection. But people with low levels of stomach acid such as children, older adults, and people who take antacids, H-2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors lack this protection, so they're at greater risk of cholera. For reasons that aren't entirely clear, people with type O blood are twice as likely to develop cholera compared with people with other blood types. Although industrialized nations no longer have large-scale cholera outbreaks, eating shellfish from waters known to harbor the bacteria greatly increases the risk.",,"The goal is to replace lost fluids and electrolytes using a simple rehydration solution, oral rehydration salts (ORS). Without rehydration, approximately half the people with cholera die. Seek immediate medical care if one develop severe diarrhea or vomiting and are in or have very recently returned from a country where cholera occurs. If one believe one has been exposed to cholera, but the symptoms are not severe, call the family doctor.

Congenital heart defects in children,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/congenital-heart-defects-children/symptoms-causes/syc-20350074,,,"The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. To pump blood throughout the body, the heart uses its left and right sides for different tasks. In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen then returns to the heart's left side through the pulmonary veins. When blood vessels or heart valves are narrow because of a heart defect, the heart must work harder to pump blood through them. For example, in hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart hasn't developed enough to effectively pump enough blood to the body.","Most congenital heart defects result from problems early in the child's heart development, the cause of which is unknown. Certain medications taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects, including congenital heart defects. Medications known to increase the risk of congenital heart defects include thalidomide (Thalomid), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, the acne medication isotretinoin (Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and lithium. Many children with Down syndrome which is caused by an extra 21st chromosome (trisomy 21) have heart defects. A missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 22 also causes heart defects. One can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects by carefully controlling the diabetes before attempting to conceive and during pregnancy. Avoid alcohol during pregnancy because it increases the risk of congenital heart defects.","The child's doctor may initially suspect a problem because he or she hears a heart murmur during a routine exam. Most heart murmurs are innocent, meaning that there is no heart defect and the murmur isn't dangerous to the child's health. Some murmurs, however, may mean blood is flowing through the child's heart abnormally because he or she has a heart defect. If it's possible the child has a heart defect, the doctor or the child's doctor may order several tests to see if the child has a heart problem. The child's doctor may use a regular echocardiogram to diagnose a congenital heart defect after the child has been born. In this noninvasive test, the child's doctor performs an ultrasound to produce images of the heart. An echocardiogram allows the doctor to see the child's heart in motion and to identify abnormalities in the heart muscle and valves. In this test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at the baby's groin and guided through it into the heart. Catheterization is sometimes necessary because it may give the child's doctor a much more detailed view of the child's heart defect than an echocardiogram. This test allows the doctor to see if the child has a heart defect before he or she is born, allowing the doctor to better plan treatment. This noninvasive test records the electrical activity of the child's heart and can help diagnose heart defects or rhythm problems. The child may have a chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged, or if the lungs have extra blood or other fluid in them.","A congenital heart defect may have no long-term effect on the child's health in some instances, such defects can safely go untreated. Depending on the type of heart defect the child has, doctors treat congenital heart defects with: Procedures using catheterization. Some children and adults now have their congenital heart defects repaired using catheterization techniques, which allow the repair to be done without surgically opening the chest and heart. In procedures that can be done using catheterization, the doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into a leg vein and guides it to the heart with the help of X-ray images. Some mild congenital heart defects, especially those found later in childhood or adulthood, can be treated with medications that help the heart work more efficiently. Drugs known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta blockers and medications that cause fluid loss (diuretics) can help ease stress on the heart by lowering blood pressure, heart rate and the amount of fluid in the chest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Congenital_heart_anomalies_world_map-Deaths_per_million_persons-WHO2012.svg

Tests to diagnose or rule out congenital heart disease include Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG can diagnose many heart problems, including irregular heartbeats and blocked arteries. The doctor can use this test to see how the heart's chambers and valves are pumping blood through the heart. If more-detailed images of the heart are needed, the doctor may recommend a transesophageal echocardiogram. Cardiac MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of the heart. The doctor might use this test to check blood flow and blood pressures in the heart. Then, the doctor gently inserts a catheter into an artery or vein in the groin, neck or arm and up to the heart.",,,"If one is an adult with congenital heart disease, one is at risk of developing complications even if one had surgery to repair a defect during childhood. A device that helps control the heart rate (pacemaker) or that corrects life-threatening irregular heartbeats (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or ICD) may help improve some of the complications associated with congenital heart defects.

Examination of the rectum and lower, or sigmoid, colon (sigmoidoscopy). In this procedure, the doctor inserts a lighted, flexible tube into the anus to examine the rectum and the lower portion of the colon.

Encouraging the child to make simple dietary changes such as eating more fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and drinking more water can go a long way toward alleviating constipation.,"Constipation most commonly occurs when waste or stool moves too slowly through the digestive tract, causing the stool to become hard and dry. Many factors can contribute to constipation in children, including Withholding. Painful bowel movements caused by large, hard stools also may lead to withholding. If toilet training becomes a battle of wills, a voluntary decision to ignore the urge to poop can quickly become an involuntary habit that's tough to change. Any changes in the child's routine such as travel, hot weather or stress can affect bowel function. An allergy to cow's milk or consuming too many dairy products (cheese and cow's milk) sometimes leads to constipation. Rarely, constipation in children indicates an anatomic malformation, a metabolic or digestive system problem, or another underlying condition.",,"The child's doctor will: More-extensive testing is usually reserved for only the most severe cases of constipation. The child's physical exam will likely include placing a gloved finger into the child's anus to check for abnormalities or the presence of impacted stool. This standard X-ray test allows the child's doctor to see if there are any blockages in the child's abdomen. In this test, a thin tube called a catheter is placed in the rectum to measure the coordination of the muscles the child uses to pass stool. In this test, the lining of the bowel is coated with a contrast dye (barium) so that the rectum, colon and sometimes part of the small intestine can be clearly seen on an X-ray. In this test, the child will swallow a capsule containing markers that show up on X-rays taken over several days.","Depending on the circumstances, the child's doctor may recommend: Over-the-counter fiber supplements or stool softeners. If an accumulation of fecal material creates a blockage, the child's doctor may suggest a laxative or enema to help remove the blockage. In addition to changes in diet and routine, various alternative approaches may help relieve constipation in children: If the child's constipation lasts longer than two weeks, one will likely first seek medical care from the child's doctor.

COPD,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679,,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli at the end of the smallest air passages (bronchioles) of the lungs are destroyed as a result of damaging exposure to cigarette smoke and other irritating gases and particulate matter.,"Only some chronic smokers develop clinically apparent COPD, although many smokers with long smoking histories may develop reduced lung function. COPD causes them to lose their elasticity and over-expand, which leaves some air trapped in the lungs when one exhale. In emphysema, the inner walls of the lungs air sacs (alveoli) are damaged, causing them to eventually rupture. Causes of airway obstruction include In the vast majority of people with COPD, the lung damage that leads to COPD is caused by long-term cigarette smoking. But there are likely other factors at play in the development of COPD, such as a genetic susceptibility to the disease, because not all smokers develop COPD. Other irritants can cause COPD, including cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution, and workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes. In about 1% of people with COPD, the disease results from a genetic disorder that causes low levels of a protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt).","Pipe smokers, cigar smokers and marijuana smokers also may be at risk, as well as people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke. Asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease, may be a risk factor for developing COPD. In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing COPD.","To diagnose the condition, the doctor will review the signs and symptoms, discuss the family and medical history, and discuss any exposure one has had to lung irritants especially cigarette smoke. These tests measure the amount of air one can inhale and exhale, and whether the lungs deliver enough oxygen to the blood. During the most common test, called spirometry, one blow into a large tube connected to a small machine to measure how much air the lungs can hold and how fast one can blow the air out of the lungs. Lab tests aren't used to diagnose COPD, but they may be used to determine the cause of the symptoms or rule out other conditions. For example, lab tests may be used to determine if one has the genetic disorder alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, which may be the cause of COPD in some people.",,"If one has COPD, one can take steps to feel better and slow the damage to the lungs: Control the breathing. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions, energy conservation techniques and relaxation techniques that one can use when one is short of breath. It may seem difficult to exercise when one has trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve the overall strength and endurance and strengthen the respiratory muscles. If one is overweight, losing weight can significantly help the breathing, especially during times of exertion.","Examples of these include For people who experience periods when their COPD becomes more severe, called moderate or severe acute exacerbation, short courses (for example, five days) of oral corticosteroids may prevent further worsening of COPD. A medication approved for people with severe COPD and symptoms of chronic bronchitis is roflumilast (Daliresp), a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. When other treatment has been ineffective or if cost is a factor, theophylline (Elixophyllin, Theo-24, Theochron), a less expensive medication, may help improve breathing and prevent episodes of worsening COPD. Side effects are dose related and may include nausea, headache, fast heartbeat and tremor, so tests are used to monitor blood levels of the medication. Some studies show that certain antibiotics, such as azithromycin (Zithromax), prevent episodes of worsening COPD, but side effects and antibiotic resistance may limit their use. Pulmonary rehabilitation after episodes of worsening COPD may reduce readmission to the hospital, increase the ability to participate in everyday activities and improve the quality of life. Evidence supports in-hospital use of breathing devices such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), but some research now supports the benefit of its use at home. A noninvasive ventilation therapy machine with a mask helps to improve breathing and decrease retention of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) that may lead to acute respiratory failure and hospitalization. When exacerbations occur, one may need additional medications (such as antibiotics, steroids or both), supplemental oxygen or treatment in the hospital. Once symptoms improve, the doctor can talk with one about measures to prevent future exacerbations, such as quitting smoking; taking inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators or other medications; getting the annual flu vaccine; and avoiding air pollution whenever possible.

Coronary artery disease,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613,"If the coronary arteries narrow, they can't supply enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart especially when it's beating hard, such as during exercise. As plaque continues to build up in the coronary arteries, however, one may develop the following coronary artery disease signs and symptoms: Heart attack. Women are somewhat more likely than men are to have less typical signs and symptoms of a heart attack, such as neck or jaw pain. The doctor may want to test one for coronary artery disease, especially if one has signs or symptoms of narrowed arteries. If the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs, one may develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue with activity.","Coronary artery disease develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart become damaged or diseased. Eventually, the reduced blood flow may cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. Because coronary artery disease often develops over decades, one might not notice a problem until one has a significant blockage or a heart attack.","Atherosclerosis is a process in which blood, fats such as cholesterol and other substances build up on the artery walls. If the plaque surface breaks or ruptures, blood cells called platelets clump together at the site to try to repair the artery.","Risk factors for coronary artery disease include Risk factors often occur together and one may trigger another. When grouped together, certain risk factors make one even more likely to develop coronary artery disease. For example, metabolic syndrome a cluster of conditions that includes high blood pressure; high triglycerides; low HDL, or good, cholesterol; high insulin levels and excess body fat around the waist increases the risk of coronary artery disease. A family history of heart disease is associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a close relative developed heart disease at an early age. Breathing in secondhand smoke also increases a person's risk of coronary artery disease. Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure. Lack of exercise also is associated with coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors, as well. Unrelieved stress in the life may damage the arteries as well as worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease. Eating too much food that has high amounts of saturated fat, trans fat, salt and sugar can increase the risk of coronary artery disease. Sudden drops in blood oxygen levels that occur during sleep apnea increase blood pressure and strain the cardiovascular system, possibly leading to coronary artery disease. High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women. But high levels of homocysteine may increase the risk of coronary artery disease.","During an echocardiogram, the doctor can determine whether all parts of the heart wall are contributing normally to the heart's pumping activity. During cardiac catheterization, a doctor gently inserts a catheter into an artery or vein in the groin, neck or arm and up to the heart. A CT coronary angiogram, in which one receive a contrast dye that is given by IV during a CT scan, can produce detailed images of the heart arteries. If the signs and symptoms occur most often during exercise, the doctor may ask one to walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike during an ECG. A tracer is injected into the bloodstream, and special cameras can detect areas in the heart that receive less blood flow.",,"If one has other risk factors for heart disease, the target LDL cholesterol may be below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L).

While it can sometimes be difficult to pinpoint the problem that's triggering a chronic cough, the most common causes are tobacco use, postnasal drip, asthma and acid reflux.","In one type of asthma (cough-variant asthma), a cough is the main symptom. A common but under-recognized cause of a chronic cough in adults is pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Chronic cough can also occur with fungal infections of the lung, tuberculosis (TB) infection or lung infection with nontuberculous mycobacterial organisms. COPD, a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs, includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure and heart failure, are known to cause chronic cough in some people.",,"However, many doctors opt to start treatment for one of the common causes of chronic cough rather than ordering expensive tests. The doctor may request an asthma challenge test, which checks how well one can breathe before and after inhaling the drug methacholine (Provocholine). If the doctor isn't able to find an explanation for the cough, special scope tests may be considered to look for possible causes. These tests may include A chest X-ray and spirometry, at a minimum, are typically ordered to find the cause of a chronic cough in children. Although a routine chest X-ray won't reveal the most common reasons for a cough postnasal drip, acid reflux or asthma it may be used to check for lung cancer, pneumonia and other lung diseases. Using a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (bronchoscope), the doctor can look at the lungs and air passages. Using a fiberoptic scope (rhinoscope), the doctor can view the nasal passageways, sinuses and upper airway.","In many cases, more than one underlying condition may be causing the chronic cough. If one is taking an ACE inhibitor medication, the doctor may switch one to another medicine that doesn't have cough as a side effect. Medications used to treat chronic cough may include Antihistamines, corticosteroids and decongestants. The most effective treatments for asthma-related cough are corticosteroids and bronchodilators, which reduce inflammation and open up the airways. If a bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial infection is causing the chronic cough, the doctor may prescribe medications to address the infection. When lifestyle changes don't take care of acid reflux, one may be treated with medications that block acid production.","In the meantime, one can also try these tips to ease the cough: Drink fluids. Smoking or breathing secondhand smoke irritates the lungs and can worsen coughs caused by other factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some people with Crohn's disease, only the last segment of the small intestine (ileum) is affected. The most common areas affected by Crohn's disease are the last part of the small intestine and the colon.","The colon, also called the large intestine, is a long, tubelike organ in the abdomen. While there's no known cure for Crohn's disease, therapies can greatly reduce its signs and symptoms and even bring about long-term remission.","Previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate but don't cause Crohn's disease. Crohn's is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more susceptible. However, most people with Crohn's disease don't have a family history of the disease.","Crohn's disease can occur at any age, but one is likely to develop the condition when one is young. Although Crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, whites have the highest risk, including people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. However, the incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing among blacks who live in North America and the United Kingdom. If one live in an urban area or in an industrialized country, one is more likely to develop Crohn's disease. This suggests that environmental factors, including a diet high in fat or refined foods, may play a role in Crohn's disease.","The doctor will likely use a combination of tests to help confirm a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, including Tests for anemia or infection. The doctor may suggest blood tests to check for anemia a condition in which there aren't enough red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the tissues or to check for signs of infection. One may need to provide a stool sample so that the doctor can test for hidden (occult) blood in the stool. This test allows the doctor to view the entire colon and the very end of the ileum (terminal ileum) using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with an attached camera. During the procedure, the doctor can also take small samples of tissue (biopsy) for laboratory analysis, which may help confirm a diagnosis.",,"Here are some suggestions that may help: Limit fiber, if it's a problem food. If one has inflammatory bowel disease, high-fiber foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, may make the symptoms worse. In general, one may have more problems with foods in the cabbage family, such as broccoli and cauliflower, and nuts, seeds, corn and popcorn. Smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease, and once one has it, smoking can make it worse. Although stress doesn't cause Crohn's disease, it can make the signs and symptoms worse and may trigger flare-ups. Although it's not always possible to avoid stress, one can learn ways to help manage it, such as: Limit dairy products. Many people with inflammatory bowel disease find that problems such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and gas improve by limiting or eliminating dairy products. One may be lactose intolerant that is, the body can't digest the milk sugar (lactose) in dairy foods. If one has Crohn's disease of the small intestine, one may not be able to digest or absorb fat normally. Spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine may make the signs and symptoms worse.

Caused by a genetic mutation, this disease causes certain nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to waste away. Signs and symptoms, including a severe decline in thinking (cognitive) skills, usually appear around age 30 or 40. Many people with Parkinson's disease eventually develop dementia symptoms (Parkinson's disease dementia). Multiple sclerosis and other conditions caused by the body's immune system attacking nerve cells also can cause dementia. Side effects of medications, a reaction to a medication or an interaction of several medications can cause dementia-like symptoms. Rarely, dementia can result from damage caused by a brain tumor. This condition, which is caused by enlarged ventricles in the brain, can cause walking problems, urinary difficulty and memory loss.","However, dementia isn't a normal part of aging, and dementia can occur in younger people. And while no specific diet is known to reduce dementia risk, research indicates a greater incidence of dementia in people who eat an unhealthy diet compared with those who follow a Mediterranean-style diet rich in produce, whole grains, nuts and seeds. If one drink large amounts of alcohol, one might have a higher risk of dementia. Although not yet well-understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia. Having diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled. Smoking might increase the risk of developing dementia and blood vessel (vascular) diseases. Low levels of vitamin D, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate may increase the risk of dementia.","People have dementia when they have cognitive impairment and lose their ability to perform daily functions, such as taking their medication, paying bills and driving safely. To diagnose the cause of the dementia, the doctor must recognize the pattern of the loss of skills and function and determine what a person is still able to do. No single test can diagnose dementia, so doctors are likely to run a number of tests that can help pinpoint the problem. A number of tests measure thinking skills, such as memory, orientation, reasoning and judgment, language skills, and attention. Doctors evaluate the memory, language, visual perception, attention, problem-solving, movement, senses, balance, reflexes and other areas. Simple blood tests can detect physical problems that can affect brain function, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency or an underactive thyroid gland. These can show patterns of brain activity and whether the amyloid protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, has been deposited in the brain.",,"The main benefits of exercise in people with dementia include improved strength, balance and cardiovascular health. There is growing evidence that exercise also protects the brain from dementia, especially when combined with a healthy diet and treatment for risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Some research also shows that physical activity might slow the progression of impaired thinking in people with Alzheimer's disease, and it can lessen symptoms of depression. Limiting caffeine, discouraging napping and offering opportunities for exercise during the day might ease nighttime restlessness. Support groups, legal advisers, family members and others might be able to help. Dancing, painting, gardening, cooking, singing and other activities can be fun, can help one connect with the loved one, and can help the loved one focus on what he or she can still do. A calendar might help the loved one remember upcoming events, daily activities and medication schedules.","These medications including donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgment. Although primarily used to treat Alzheimer's disease, these medications might also be prescribed for other dementias, including vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy body dementia. Memantine (Namenda) works by regulating the activity of glutamate, another chemical messenger involved in brain functions, such as learning and memory. Several dementia symptoms and behavior problems might be treated initially using nondrug approaches, such as: Cholinesterase inhibitors. The doctor might prescribe medications to treat other symptoms or conditions, such as depression, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, parkinsonism or agitation. The purpose is to prevent accidents, such as falls; manage behavior; and prepare one for the dementia progression.","Neurology, psychiatry","Decreased ability to think and remember, emotional problems, problems with language, decreased motivation",Gradual,Long term,"Alzheimer's disease, vascular disease, Lewy body disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.",,Cognitive testing (Mini-Mental State Examination),"Early education, prevent high blood pressure, prevent obesity, no smoking, social engagement",Supportive care,,50 million (2020),Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (small benefit),https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/A_man_diagnosed_as_suffering_from_acute_dementia._Lithograph_Wellcome_L0026694.jpg

Research has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.","A diagnostic work-up would likely include the following tests: The doctor will perform a physical exam and likely assess overall neurological health by testing the following: Blood tests may help the doctor rule out other potential causes of memory loss and confusion, such as a thyroid disorder or vitamin deficiencies. Images of the brain are now used chiefly to pinpoint visible abnormalities related to conditions other than Alzheimer's disease such as strokes, trauma or tumors that may cause cognitive change.

But, no matter what type of diabetes one has, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes when the blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes and gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby is delivered.","Instead of moving into the cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too.

It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including Any pregnant woman can develop gestational diabetes, but some women are at greater risk than are others. If one has these autoantibodies, one has an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. The risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. If one developed gestational diabetes when one were pregnant, the risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases. If one gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), one is also at risk of type 2 diabetes. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity increases the risk of diabetes. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. If one has low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or good, cholesterol, the risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk increases if one has prediabetes a precursor to type 2 diabetes or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes.

The baby may be more prone to diaper rash if he or she is experiencing frequent bowel movements or diarrhea because feces are more irritating than urine. These rashes can be found within the creases of the skin, and there may be red dots scattered around the creases. Changes in the baby's diet can also increase the frequency of stools, which can lead to diaper rash. If the baby is breast-fed, he or she may develop diaper rash in response to something the mother has eaten. Babies with skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis or seborrheic dermatitis (eczema), may be more likely to develop diaper rash. However, the irritated skin of atopic dermatitis and eczema primarily affects areas other than the diaper area. When a baby takes antibiotics, bacteria that keep yeast growth in check may be depleted, resulting in diaper rash due to yeast infection.",,,"The best treatment for diaper rash is to keep the baby's skin as clean and dry as possible.

One may feel dizzy, faint or off balance if the heart isn't pumping enough blood to the brain. If one also have sudden hearing loss, one may have labyrinthitis. One may also experience fluctuating hearing loss, ringing in the ear and the feeling of a plugged ear. Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, heart attack, heart arrhythmia and transient ischemic attack could cause dizziness. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medications such as anti-seizure drugs, antidepressants, sedatives and tranquilizers. In particular, blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if they lower the blood pressure too much.

Most heart murmurs are innocent, meaning that there is no heart defect and the murmur isn't dangerous to the child's health. Some murmurs, however, may mean blood is flowing through the child's heart abnormally because he or she has a heart defect. If it's possible the child has a heart defect, the doctor or the child's doctor may order several tests to see if the child has a heart problem. The child's doctor may use a regular echocardiogram to diagnose a congenital heart defect after the child has been born. In this noninvasive test, the child's doctor performs an ultrasound to produce images of the heart. An echocardiogram allows the doctor to see the child's heart in motion and to identify abnormalities in the heart muscle and valves. In this test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at the baby's groin and guided through it into the heart. Catheterization is sometimes necessary because it may give the child's doctor a much more detailed view of the child's heart defect than an echocardiogram. This test allows the doctor to see if the child has a heart defect before he or she is born, allowing the doctor to better plan treatment. This noninvasive test records the electrical activity of the child's heart and can help diagnose heart defects or rhythm problems. The child may have a chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged, or if the lungs have extra blood or other fluid in them.","A congenital heart defect may have no long-term effect on the child's health in some instances, such defects can safely go untreated. Depending on the type of heart defect the child has, doctors treat congenital heart defects with: Procedures using catheterization. Some children and adults now have their congenital heart defects repaired using catheterization techniques, which allow the repair to be done without surgically opening the chest and heart. In procedures that can be done using catheterization, the doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into a leg vein and guides it to the heart with the help of X-ray images. Some mild congenital heart defects, especially those found later in childhood or adulthood, can be treated with medications that help the heart work more efficiently.

Here, a hole between the heart's main pumping chambers (ventricular septal defect) causes increased blood flow to the pulmonary arteries. Eisenmenger syndrome occurs when the pressure in the pulmonary arteries becomes so high that it causes oxygen-poor (blue) blood to flow from the right to left ventricle and then to the body, causing cyanosis.","In performing its basic job pumping blood throughout the body the heart uses its left and right sides for different tasks. In the lungs, oxygen enriches the blood, which circulates to the heart's left side. The left side of the heart pumps blood into a large vessel called the aorta, which circulates blood to the rest of the body. A family history of heart defects also increases the risk of a baby being born with a congenital heart defect, including the possibility of developing Eisenmenger syndrome. An atrial septal defect is a shunt in the wall of tissue that divides the right and left sides of the upper chambers of the heart (atria).",,"In this test, doctors insert a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into a vein and artery in the groin and guide the catheter to the heart using X-ray imaging. Doctors use cardiac catheterization to measure blood pressure in the blood vessels or heart's chambers, the size of any septal defect, the pressures across the defect, and the amount of blood in the heart and lungs. Blood tests may be done to check the blood cell counts, which are often high in Eisenmenger syndrome. The kidney and liver function, as well as the iron level, also may be measured with blood tests. In this test, one will lie in a machine that takes images of the heart and lungs so that the doctors can see a cross section of them. This test, which uses no X-rays, is sometimes used to get images of the blood vessels in the lungs and heart structure.",,"Because of the low oxygen levels at high altitudes, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend against living at an altitude of 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) or higher above sea level. Many prescription and over-the-counter medications or supplements may increase or decrease blood pressure, increase risk of bleeding or blood clots, or affect kidney function in patients who have Eisenmenger syndrome.","One will need to be monitored closely by a doctor when taking medications for any changes in blood pressure, fluid volume or pulse rate. If one has had a stroke, blood clot or certain types of irregular heart rhythms, the doctor may recommend aspirin or other blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven). However, people who have Eisenmenger syndrome are also at increased risk of bleeding when taking these medications, so don't take any blood thinners unless the doctor tells one to do so. Don't take over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen (Aleve, others), without talking to the doctor first. Antibiotics taken before these procedures can help destroy or control the harmful bacteria that may lead to an infection of the heart's tissues (endocarditis). Antibiotics are recommended only before certain dental procedures (those that cut the gum tissue or part of the teeth) and procedures involving the respiratory tract, infected skin or tissue that connects muscle to bone.

Elevated blood pressure,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prehypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20376703,,,,"Risk factors for elevated blood pressure include Although elevated blood pressure and high blood pressure are most common in adults, children can be at risk, too. For some children, kidney or heart problems can cause high blood pressure. But for a growing number of kids, poor lifestyle habits, such as an unhealthy diet, obesity and lack of exercise, contribute to elevated blood pressure and high blood pressure. Younger adults are more likely to have elevated blood pressure than are older adults because the risk of hypertension increases as one age. Even children can develop elevated blood pressure, especially if they're overweight or obese. High blood pressure is particularly common among people of African heritage, often developing at an earlier age than it does in white people. If a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, has high blood pressure, one is more likely to develop the condition. If one has too much sodium or too little potassium in the diet, one is more likely to have high blood pressure. Smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco or being around others who smoke (secondhand smoke) can increase the blood pressure. Kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea, among others, can increase the risk of elevated blood pressure.","A blood pressure reading, given in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), has two numbers. Other blood pressure measurements are categorized as: Because blood pressure tends to fluctuate, a diagnosis of elevated blood pressure is based on the average of two or more blood pressure readings taken on separate occasions in a consistent manner. The doctor might also recommend that one use a home blood pressure monitor, preferably one that can store the readings in its memory, to check the blood pressure regularly. Elevated blood pressure is a systolic pressure ranging from 120 to 129 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure below 80 mm Hg. More-severe hypertension, stage 2 hypertension, is a systolic pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or a diastolic pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher.","If one has elevated blood pressure accompanied by diabetes, kidney disease or cardiovascular disease, the doctor might recommend blood pressure medication in addition to lifestyle changes. If one has been diagnosed with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of medication are less clear. Regular physical activity can help lower the blood pressure, manage stress, reduce the risk of other health problems and keep the weight under control. For most healthy adults, the Department of Health and Human Services recommends that one get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. If one think one may have elevated blood pressure or high blood pressure, make an appointment with the family doctor to have the blood pressure checked. Because some medications such as over-the-counter cold medicines, pain medications, antidepressants, birth control pills and others can raise the blood pressure, bring a list of all medications, vitamins and other supplements one take and their doses to the doctor's appointment. Getting to and maintaining a healthy weight Eating a healthy, low-salt diet Exercising regularly Limiting the amount of alcohol one drink Quitting smoking Eat healthy foods. Get plenty of potassium, which can help lower blood pressure. Keeping a healthy weight, or losing weight if one is overweight or obese, can help one control the blood pressure and lower the risk of related health problems.

Cold air can cause spasms of the bronchial passages, making it even more difficult to breathe. During cold weather, wear a soft scarf or a cold-air mask available from a pharmacy over the mouth and nose before going outside, to warm the air entering the lungs. If one has to mingle with large groups of people during cold and flu season, wear a face mask, wash the hands frequently and carry a small bottle of alcohol-based hand sanitizer to use when needed.","Depending upon the severity of the symptoms, the doctor might suggest: Depending on the severity of the emphysema, the doctor may suggest one or more different types of surgery, including Bronchodilators.

In eosinophilic esophagitis (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik uh-sof-uh-JIE-tis), a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the lining of the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (esophagus).","The reaction may occur as follows: There has been a significant increase in numbers of people diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in the past decade. However, studies now suggest the disease is becoming increasingly common, parallel to the increase in asthma and allergy. Inflammation can lead to scarring, narrowing and formation of excessive fibrous tissue in the lining of the esophagus.","People who live in a cold or dry climate are more likely than those in other climates to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis. One is more likely to be diagnosed between the spring and fall, probably because levels of pollen and other allergens are higher and people are more prone to be outdoors. If the family members have eosinophilic esophagitis, one has a greater chance of being diagnosed. If one has food or environmental allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis or a chronic respiratory disease, one is more likely to be diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis. Originally, eosinophilic esophagitis was thought to be a childhood disease, but now it is known to be common in adults as well.","Endoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube (endoscope) down the throat and into the esophagus. A tiny camera on the end of the endoscope lets the doctor examine the esophagus, stomach and the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum). The doctor will use a long narrow tube (endoscope) containing a light and tiny camera and insert it through the mouth down the esophagus. The doctor will inspect the lining of the esophagus for inflammation and swelling, horizontal rings, vertical furrows, narrowing (strictures), and white spots. If doctors suspect eosinophilic esophagitis, one may be given some additional tests to confirm the diagnosis and to begin to look for the sources of the allergic reaction (allergens).",,"If one often have heartburn, these lifestyle changes may help reduce the frequency or severity of symptoms: Maintain a healthy weight. If one is overweight or obese, work to slowly lose weight no more than 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/churg-strauss-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353760,"Also known as EGPA, the syndrome tends to occur in three stages and gets progressively worse. Almost everyone with the condition has asthma, chronic sinusitis and elevated counts of white blood cells called eosinophils. Asthma usually begins five to nine years before the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome. Churg-Strauss syndrome is rare, and it's more likely that these symptoms have some other cause.","Churg-Strauss syndrome is a disorder marked by blood vessel inflammation. The disorder can also cause other problems, such as hay fever, rash, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pain and numbness in the hands and feet.","It's likely that a combination of genes and environmental factors, such as allergens or certain medications, triggers an overactive immune system response. Instead of protecting against invading bacteria and viruses, the immune system targets healthy tissue, causing widespread inflammation.",,"The early signs and symptoms, such as asthma and sinusitis, tend to be fairly commonplace, so a diagnosis might not be made until the inflammation has caused serious damage to organs and nerves. The criteria are: To diagnose Churg-Strauss syndrome, the doctor is likely to request several tests, including Blood tests. When the immune system attacks the body's own cells, as happens in Churg-Strauss syndrome, it forms proteins called autoantibodies. A blood test can detect certain autoantibodies in the blood that can suggest, but not confirm, a diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome. Most people diagnosed with Churg-Strauss syndrome have chronic, often severe asthma. If other tests suggest Churg-Strauss syndrome, one might have a small sample of tissue removed for examination under a microscope.","There's no cure for Churg-Strauss syndrome, also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). But because high doses of corticosteroids can cause serious side effects, the doctor will decrease the dose gradually until one is taking the smallest amount that will keep the disease under control. Side effects of corticosteroids include bone loss, high blood sugar, weight gain, cataracts and hard-to-treat infections. Other people require another immunosuppressive drug, such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran) or methotrexate (Trexall), to further reduce the body's immune reaction. Because these drugs impair the body's ability to fight infection and can cause other serious side effects, the condition will be closely monitored while one is taking them. Drugs such as the recently Food and Drug Administration-approved mepolizumab (Nucala), as well as benralizumab (Fasenra) and rituximab (Rituxan), alter the immune system's response and seem to improve symptoms and decrease the number of eosinophils. One can minimize these problems by taking the following steps: Here are some suggestions for coping with Churg-Strauss syndrome: If one has signs and symptoms common to Churg-Strauss syndrome, make an appointment with the doctor. If the primary care doctor suspects Churg-Strauss syndrome, he or she will likely refer one to a doctor who specializes in disorders that cause blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), such as a rheumatologist or immunologist. Exercise can help one maintain a healthy weight, which is important when one is taking corticosteroid medications that can cause weight gain. Besides causing serious health problems, smoking also worsens problems one has and can increase side effects of medications.","Exercise can help one maintain a healthy weight, which is important when one is taking corticosteroid medications that can cause weight gain.

Genetic testing may determine if the MEFV gene contains a mutation that is associated with familial Mediterranean fever. Genetic tests aren't advanced enough to test for every gene mutation that's linked to familial Mediterranean fever, so there is a possibility of false-negative results. For this reason, doctors typically don't use genetic tests as the sole method of diagnosing familial Mediterranean fever.","Medications used to control signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever include Learning that one or the child has a chronic illness, such as familial Mediterranean fever, can be upsetting and frustrating. Here are some tips that may help one cope: If one has signs and symptoms of familial Mediterranean fever, one may begin by seeing the family doctor. For people whose signs and symptoms aren't controlled with colchicine, medications that block a protein called interleukin-1, which is involved in inflammation, may be prescribed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Erysipeloid_skin_rashes_in_Familial_Mediterranean_Fever.jpg

The amount of amniotic fluid reflects the baby's urine output, and a larger baby produces more urine. During prenatal visits, the health care provider might measure the fundal height the distance from the top of the uterus to the pubic bone.","The term fetal macrosomia is used to describe a newborn who's much larger than average. A baby who is diagnosed as having fetal macrosomia weighs more than 8 pounds, 13 ounces (4,000 grams), regardless of his or her gestational age. Risks associated with fetal macrosomia increase greatly when birth weight is more than 9 pounds, 15 ounces (4,500 grams).",,"Many factors might increase the risk of fetal macrosomia some one can control, but others one can't. Fetal macrosomia is more likely if one had diabetes before pregnancy (pre-gestational diabetes) or if one develop diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). If the diabetes isn't well controlled, the baby is likely to have larger shoulders and greater amounts of body fat than would a baby whose mother doesn't have diabetes. Fetal macrosomia is more likely to be a result of maternal diabetes, obesity or weight gain during pregnancy than other causes. If these risk factors aren't present and fetal macrosomia is suspected, it's possible that the baby might have a rare medical condition that affects fetal growth. Up to the fifth pregnancy, the average birth weight for each successive pregnancy typically increases by up to about 4 ounces (113 grams). If the pregnancy continues by more than two weeks past the due date, the baby is at increased risk of fetal macrosomia.","However, if one has risk factors for fetal macrosomia, the health care provider will likely use tests to monitor the baby's health and development while one is pregnant, such as: Ultrasound. Toward the end of the third trimester, the health care provider or another member of the health care team might do an ultrasound to take measurements of parts of the baby's body, such as the head, abdomen and femur. If the health care provider suspects fetal macrosomia, he or she might perform antenatal testing, such as a nonstress test or a fetal biophysical profile, to monitor the baby's well-being. A fetal biophysical profile combines nonstress testing with ultrasound to monitor the baby's movement, tone, breathing and volume of amniotic fluid. If the baby's excess growth is thought to be the result of a maternal condition, the health care provider might recommend antenatal testing starting as early as week 32 of pregnancy.","If one had diabetes before pregnancy or one develop gestational diabetes and the health care provider estimates that the baby weighs 9 pounds, 15 ounces (4,500 grams) or more, a C-section might be the safest way to deliver the baby.

Improper training techniques, such as not warming up and stretching, also can cause foot injuries. Whether one is a trained athlete or someone who's just started exercising, suddenly boosting the frequency or duration of the exercise sessions can increase the risk of a stress fracture. Certain work environments, such as a construction site, put one at risk of falling from a height or dropping something heavy on the foot.","The technician may need to take X-rays from several different angles so that the bone images won't overlap too much. CT scans can reveal more detail about the bone and the soft tissues that surround it, which may help the doctor determine the best treatment. This imaging helps to show ligaments and bones and can identify fractures not seen on X-rays.",,,"Minor foot fractures may only need a removable brace, boot or shoe with a stiff sole. If one has a displaced fracture, meaning the two ends of the fracture are not aligned, the doctor may need to manipulate the pieces back into their proper positions a process called reduction.

A broken arm involves one or more of the three bones in the arm the ulna, radius and humerus. A more complicated break might require surgery to realign the broken bone and to implant wires, plates, nails or screws to keep the bone in place during healing.","Common causes for a broken arm include Falls. Falling onto an outstretched hand or elbow is the most common cause of a broken arm. Direct blows and injuries on the field or court cause all types of arm fractures.

In wind chill of minus 16.6 F (minus 27 C), frostbite can occur on exposed skin in less than 30 minutes.",,"The diagnosis of frostbite is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, the appearance of the skin, and a review of recent activities in which one were exposed to cold. The doctor may conduct tests, such as an X-ray, a bone scan or an MRI. As winter drags on and temperatures drop way down, the risk of cold-related injury like frostbite can go way up. We tend to see frostbite, for example, when the temperature is 5 degrees Fahrenheit with minimal windchill, Dr. Kakar explains. If the windchill drops below negative 15 degrees Fahrenheit, not unheard of in the northern half of the U.S. frostbite can set in within half an hour. The most vulnerable areas of frostbite are the nose, ears, fingers and toes. Initially with the milder forms, one can get some pain and some numbness of the tips, but the skin can change its color, Dr. Kakar says. Those most at risk are certain patients with diabetes, patients who have previous history of frostbite are prone to it, the elderly or the very young children, and also, for example, if one is dehydrated, he says.","For all other frostbite, after appropriate first aid and assessment for hypothermia, treatment may involve rewarming, medications, wound care, surgery and various therapies, depending on the severity of the injury. Once the skin thaws, the doctor may loosely wrap the area with sterile sheets, towels or dressings to protect the skin. To heal properly, frostbitten skin needs to be free of damaged, dead or infected tissue. To better distinguish between healthy and dead tissue, the doctor may wait one to three months before removing damaged tissue. Soaking in a whirlpool bath (hydrotherapy) can aid healing by keeping skin clean and naturally removing dead tissue. If the skin or blisters appear infected, the doctor may prescribe oral antibiotics. One may receive an intravenous injection (IV) of a drug that helps restore blood flow (thrombolytic), such as tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). A variety of wound care techniques may be used, depending on the extent of injury. People who have experienced severe frostbite may in time need surgery or amputation to remove dead or decaying tissue.","To care for the skin after frostbite: Take all medications antibiotics or pain medicine as prescribed by the doctor.

If one has gas gangrene, the surface of the skin may initially appear normal. Gas gangrene is most commonly caused by infection with the bacterium Clostridium perfringens, which develops in an injury or surgical wound that's depleted of blood supply. If bacteria thrive unchecked for long, infection can take over and cause the tissue to die, causing gangrene. Fournier's gangrene usually arises due to an infection in the genital area or urinary tract and causes genital pain, tenderness, redness and swelling. This rare type of gangrene typically occurs after an operation, with painful skin lesions developing one to two weeks after surgery.","If one has diabetes, the body doesn't produce enough of the hormone insulin (which helps the cells take up blood sugar) or is resistant to the effects of insulin. High blood sugar levels can eventually damage blood vessels, decreasing or interrupting blood flow to a part of the body. Hardened and narrowed arteries (atherosclerosis) and blood clots also can block blood flow to an area of the body. Any process that causes trauma to the skin and underlying tissue, including an injury or frostbite, increases the risk of developing gangrene, especially if one has an underlying condition that affects blood flow to the injured area. Obesity often accompanies diabetes and vascular disease, but the stress of extra weight alone can also compress arteries, leading to reduced blood flow and increasing the risk of infection and poor wound healing.

In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage. Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma, occurs when the iris bulges forward to narrow or block the drainage angle formed by the cornea and iris. In normal-tension glaucoma, the optic nerve becomes damaged even though the eye pressure is within the normal range.

Atherosclerosis refers to the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls (plaque), which can restrict blood flow.",,,"During a physical exam, the doctor may find signs of narrowed, enlarged or hardened arteries, including Depending on the results of the physical exam, the doctor may suggest one or more diagnostic tests, including Blood tests. A stress test, also called an exercise stress test, is used to gather information about how well the heart works during physical activity. Because exercise makes the heart pump harder and faster than it does during most daily activities, an exercise stress test can reveal problems within the heart that might not be noticeable otherwise. An exercise stress test usually involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart rhythm, blood pressure and breathing are monitored. In some types of stress tests, pictures will be taken of the heart, such as during a stress echocardiogram (ultrasound) or nuclear stress test.

Try substituting whole-grain bread in place of white bread; grabbing an apple, a banana or carrot sticks as a snack; and reading nutrition labels as a guide to controlling the amount of salt and fat one eat. If one is overweight, losing as few as 5 to 10 pounds (about 2.3 to 4.5 kilograms) can help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, two of the major risk factors for developing atherosclerosis. If one has high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or another chronic disease, work with the doctor to manage the condition and promote overall health. If one smoke or use tobacco in any form, quitting is the best way to halt the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of complications.","Aggressively lowering the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the bad cholesterol, can slow, stop or even reverse the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. Boosting the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the good cholesterol, may help, too. The doctor can choose from a range of cholesterol medications, including drugs known as statins and fibrates. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins have additional effects that help stabilize the lining of the heart arteries and prevent atherosclerosis. If one has severe symptoms or a blockage that threatens muscle or skin tissue survival, one may be a candidate for one of the following surgical procedures: Angioplasty and stent placement. In this procedure, the doctor inserts a long, thin tube (catheter) into the blocked or narrowed part of the artery. The doctor may prescribe anti-platelet medications, such as aspirin, to reduce the likelihood that platelets will clump in narrowed arteries, form a blood clot and cause further blockage. These medications may help slow the progression of atherosclerosis by lowering blood pressure and producing other beneficial effects on the heart arteries. The doctor may suggest certain medications to control specific risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as diabetes.

Heart arrhythmias,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/symptoms-causes/syc-20350668,"If this occurs, follow these steps: Find out if an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available nearby. If there's no one nearby trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), provide hands-only CPR. If one or someone nearby knows CPR, begin providing it if it's needed.","Heart rhythm problems (heart arrhythmias) occur when the electrical impulses that coordinate the heartbeats don't work properly, causing the heart to beat too fast, too slow or irregularly. However, some heart arrhythmias may cause bothersome sometimes even life-threatening signs and symptoms. In addition, because troublesome heart arrhythmias are often made worse or are even caused by a weak or damaged heart, one may be able to reduce the arrhythmia risk by adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle. Doctors classify arrhythmias not only by where they originate (atria or ventricles) but also by the speed of heart rate they cause: Not all tachycardias or bradycardias mean one has heart disease. Ventricular fibrillation occurs when rapid, chaotic electrical impulses cause the ventricles to quiver ineffectively instead of pumping necessary blood to the body. The rapid heartbeats, caused by changes in the electrical system of the heart, may lead to fainting, and can be life-threatening. If one is physically fit, one may have an efficient heart capable of pumping an adequate supply of blood with fewer than 60 beats a minute at rest. However, if one has a slow heart rate and the heart isn't pumping enough blood, one may have one of several bradycardias, including Conduction block. A block of the heart's electrical pathways can occur in or near the AV node, which lies on the pathway between the atria and the ventricles. If the signal is completely blocked, certain cells in the AV node or ventricles can make a steady, although usually slower, heartbeat. Premature heartbeats may occur when one is resting or may sometimes be caused by stress, strenuous exercise or stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine. This pathway may allow electrical signals to pass between the atria and the ventricles without passing through the AV node, leading to short circuits and rapid heartbeats. Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid, regular heart rate that originates with abnormal electrical signals in the ventricles. Ventricular tachycardia may not cause serious problems if one has an otherwise healthy heart, but it can be a medical emergency that requires prompt medical treatment if one has heart disease or a weak heart. If the sinus node, which is responsible for setting the pace of the heart, isn't sending impulses properly, the heart rate may alternate between too slow (bradycardia) and too fast (tachycardia).",,"These include Other factors that may put one at higher risk of developing an arrhythmia include Coronary artery disease, other heart problems and previous heart surgery. Narrowed heart arteries, a heart attack, abnormal heart valves, prior heart surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other heart damage are risk factors for almost any kind of arrhythmia. It may also cause the walls of the left ventricle to become stiff and thick, which can change how electrical impulses travel through the heart. Substances in the blood called electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium help trigger and conduct the electrical impulses in the heart. Caffeine, nicotine and other stimulants can cause the heart to beat faster and may contribute to the development of more-serious arrhythmias. Illegal drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, may profoundly affect the heart and lead to many types of arrhythmias or to sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation.","The doctor may ask about or test for conditions that may trigger the arrhythmia, such as heart disease or a problem with the thyroid gland. The doctor may also perform heart-monitoring tests specific to arrhythmias. These may include If the doctor doesn't find an arrhythmia during those tests, he or she may try to trigger the arrhythmia with other tests, which may include Electrophysiological testing and mapping. In this test, doctors thread thin, flexible tubes (catheters) tipped with electrodes through the blood vessels to a variety of spots within the heart. In addition, the cardiologist can use the electrodes to stimulate the heart to beat at rates that may trigger or halt an arrhythmia. During an ECG, sensors (electrodes) that can detect the electrical activity of the heart are attached to the chest and sometimes to the limbs. In this noninvasive test, a hand-held device (transducer) placed on the chest uses sound waves to produce images of the heart's size, structure and motion. If the symptoms are very infrequent, an event recorder may be implanted under the skin in the chest area to continually record the heart's electrical activity and detect abnormal heart rhythms. If doctors are evaluating one to determine if coronary artery disease may be causing the arrhythmia, and one has difficulty exercising, then the doctor may use a drug to stimulate the heart in a way that's similar to exercise.",,"The doctor may suggest that, in addition to other treatments, one make lifestyle changes that will keep the heart as healthy as possible. Eat a healthy diet that's low in salt and solid fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke.","The lower chambers, the right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating, which controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. That's primarily because a healthy person's heart is free from any abnormal conditions that cause an arrhythmia, such as an area of scarred tissue. Heart defects can develop as the heart develops, about a month after conception, changing the flow of blood in the heart. Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, comprising the left atrium and ventricle. During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers (left and right atria). Electrical impulses begin high in the right atrium and travel through specialized pathways to the ventricles, delivering the signal for the heart to pump. The conduction system keeps the heart beating in a coordinated and normal rhythm, which keeps blood circulating. This least common type of cardiomyopathy, which causes the heart muscle to become rigid and less elastic, can occur for no known reason.","Risk factors for developing heart disease include Age. A family history of heart disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as the brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as the mother or sister). A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors, as well. Unrelieved stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease. Not regularly washing the hands and not establishing other habits that can help prevent viral or bacterial infections can put one at risk of heart infections, especially if one already have an underlying heart condition.","Besides blood tests and a chest X-ray, tests to diagnose heart disease can include Cardiac catheterization. Aided by X-ray images on a monitor, the doctor threads the guide catheter through that artery until it reaches the heart. The dye can be seen on an X-ray, which helps the doctor see the blood flow through the heart, blood vessels and valves to check for abnormalities. Aided by X-ray images on a monitor, the doctor threads the guide catheter through that artery until it reaches the heart.The pressures in the heart chambers can be measured, and dye can be injected.","In general, treatment for heart disease usually includes: Lifestyle changes. If lifestyle changes alone aren't enough, the doctor may prescribe medications to control the heart disease.","Most people should aim for an LDL level below 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.4 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). If one has other risk factors for heart disease, one should aim for an LDL below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). If one is at very high risk of heart disease if one has already had a heart attack or have diabetes, for example aim for an even lower LDL level below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). Exercise helps one achieve and maintain a healthy weight and control diabetes, elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure all risk factors for heart disease. If the test results aren't within desirable ranges, the doctor may recommend more frequent measurements.Most people should aim for an LDL level below 130 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.4 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). If one has diabetes, tight blood sugar control can help reduce the risk of heart disease. If one has a heart arrhythmia or heart defect, there may be some restrictions on the activities one can do, so talk to the doctor.With the doctor's OK, aim for 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. A heart-healthy diet based on fruits, vegetables and whole grains and low in saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar can help one control the weight, blood pressure and cholesterol.",,Cardiology,"Chest pain, shortness of breath",Older adults,,,,,"Healthy eating, exercise, avoiding tobacco smoke, limited alcohol intake","Treating high blood pressure, high blood lipids, diabetes",,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/CC-BY_icon.svg
Heart failure,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142,"Heart failure can be ongoing (chronic), or the condition may start suddenly (acute). Heart failure signs and symptoms may include See the doctor if one think one might be experiencing signs or symptoms of heart failure. Emergency room doctors will try to stabilize the condition and determine if the symptoms are due to heart failure or something else.",,"The lower chambers, the right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. In heart failure, the main pumping chambers of the heart (the ventricles) may become stiff and not fill properly between beats. Heart failure can involve the left side (left ventricle), right side (right ventricle) or both sides of the heart. Generally, heart failure begins with the left side, specifically the left ventricle the heart's main pumping chamber. The disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) in the arteries, which reduce blood flow and can lead to heart attack. It's most commonly caused by a virus, including COVID-19, and can lead to left-sided heart failure.","A single risk factor may be enough to cause heart failure, but a combination of factors also increases the risk. Narrowed arteries may limit the heart's supply of oxygen-rich blood, resulting in weakened heart muscle. The diabetes drugs rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) have been found to increase the risk of heart failure in some people. Medications that may increase the risk of heart problems include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); certain anesthesia medications; some anti-arrhythmic medications; certain medications used to treat high blood pressure, cancer, blood conditions, neurological conditions, psychiatric conditions, lung conditions, urological conditions, inflammatory conditions and infections; and other prescription and over-the-counter medications. The inability to breathe properly while one sleep at night results in low blood oxygen levels and increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms. People with valvular heart disease have a higher risk of heart failure. These abnormal rhythms, especially if they are very frequent and fast, can weaken the heart muscle and cause heart failure.","To diagnose heart failure, the doctor will take a careful medical history, review the symptoms and perform a physical examination. The doctor can also use an X-ray to diagnose conditions other than heart failure that may explain the signs and symptoms. An echocardiogram measures the ejection fraction, an important measurement of how well the heart is pumping, and which is used to help classify heart failure and guide treatment. If the doctor also wants to see images of the heart while one is exercising, he or she may use imaging techniques to visualize the heart during the test. A dye injected through the catheter makes the arteries supplying the heart visible on an X-ray, helping doctors spot blockages. In this test, the doctor inserts a small, flexible biopsy cord into a vein in the neck or groin, and small pieces of the heart muscle are taken. To determine the most appropriate treatment for the condition, doctors may classify heart failure using two systems: New York Heart Association classification. For example, a person who has several risk factors for heart failure but no signs or symptoms of heart failure is Stage A. Someone who has heart disease and is experiencing or has experienced signs or symptoms of heart failure is Stage C. A person with advanced heart failure requiring specialized treatments is Stage D. Doctors use this classification system to identify the risk factors and begin early, more aggressive treatment to help prevent or delay heart failure. Someone who has heart disease and is experiencing or has experienced signs or symptoms of heart failure is Stage C. A person with advanced heart failure requiring specialized treatments is Stage D. Doctors use this classification system to identify the risk factors and begin early, more aggressive treatment to help prevent or delay heart failure.",,"Smoking damages the blood vessels, raises blood pressure, reduces the amount of oxygen in the blood and makes the heart beat faster. Too much sodium contributes to water retention, which makes the heart work harder and causes shortness of breath and swollen legs, ankles and feet. If one has heart failure, one may want to get influenza and pneumonia vaccinations. In addition to avoiding high-sodium foods, limit the amount of saturated fat and trans fat also called trans-fatty acids in the diet. The doctor may recommend that one don't drink alcohol if one has heart failure, since it can interact with the medication, weaken the heart muscle and increase the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. If one has severe heart failure, the doctor may also suggest one limit the amount of fluids one drink. Moderate aerobic activity helps keep the rest of the body healthy and conditioned, reducing the demands on the heart muscle. When one is anxious or upset, the heart beats faster, one breathe more heavily and the blood pressure often goes up. This can make heart failure worse, since the heart is already having trouble meeting the body's demands.","ACE inhibitors are a type of vasodilator, a drug that widens blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the workload on the heart. Beta blockers may reduce signs and symptoms of heart failure, improve heart function, and help one live longer. These are potassium-sparing diuretics, which also have additional properties that may help people with severe systolic heart failure live longer. The doctor may prescribe other heart medications as well such as nitrates for chest pain, a statin to lower cholesterol or blood-thinning medications to help prevent blood clots along with heart failure medications. While in the hospital, one may receive additional medications to help the heart pump better and relieve the symptoms. If one has severe heart failure, one may need to use supplemental oxygen long term. In some cases, doctors recommend surgery to treat the underlying problem that led to heart failure. If severely blocked arteries are contributing to the heart failure, the doctor may recommend coronary artery bypass surgery. If a faulty heart valve causes the heart failure, the doctor may recommend repairing or replacing the valve. Certain types of heart valve repair or replacement can now be done without open heart surgery, using either minimally invasive surgery or cardiac catheterization techniques. A biventricular pacemaker sends timed electrical impulses to both of the heart's lower chambers (the left and right ventricles) so that they pump in a more efficient, coordinated manner. A VAD, also known as a mechanical circulatory support device, is an implantable mechanical pump that helps pump blood from the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) to the rest of the body. If one has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), one important consideration to discuss with the family and doctors is turning off the defibrillator so that it can't deliver shocks to make the heart continue beating.",Cardiology,"Shortness of breath, feeling tired, leg swelling",,Usually lifelong,"Heart attack, high blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythm, excessive alcohol use, infection, heart damage","Smoking, sedentary lifestyle, exposure to second-hand smoke",Echocardiogram,,,,"40 million (2015), 1â€“2% of adults (developed countries)","Diuretics, cardiac medications",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/CHF2016.png
Heart murmurs,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-murmurs/symptoms-causes/syc-20373171,,,"In children, abnormal murmurs are usually caused by congenital heart disease. In adults, abnormal murmurs are most often due to acquired heart valve problems. The most common cause of abnormal murmurs in children is when babies are born with structural problems of the heart (congenital heart defects). Cardiac shunts occur when there's an abnormal blood flow between the heart chambers or blood vessels, which may lead to a heart murmur. Other causes of abnormal heart murmurs include infections and conditions that damage the structures of the heart and are more common in older children or adults. Congenital heart valve abnormalities are present at birth, but sometimes aren't discovered until much later in life. Valves may become narrowed (stenotic), making it harder for blood to flow through the heart, resulting in murmurs.","Certain medical conditions, including uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), hyperthyroidism, an infection of the lining of the heart (endocarditis), high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension), carcinoid syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, a weakened heart muscle or a history of rheumatic fever, can increase the risk of a heart murmur later in life. Having some conditions during pregnancy, such as uncontrolled diabetes or a rubella infection, increases the baby's risk of developing heart defects and a heart murmur.","Heart murmurs are usually detected when the doctor listens to the heart using a stethoscope during a physical exam. To check whether the murmur is innocent or abnormal, the doctor will consider: The doctor will also look for other signs and symptoms of heart problems and ask about the medical history and whether other family members have had heart murmurs or other heart conditions. If the doctor thinks the heart murmur is abnormal, one or the child may need additional tests, including Cardiac catheterization. In this test, a catheter is inserted into a vein or artery in the leg or arm until it reaches the heart. The dye can be seen on an X-ray, which helps the doctor see the blood flow through the heart, blood vessels and valves to check for problems. Murmurs that happen when the heart is filling with blood (diastolic murmur) or throughout the heartbeat (continuous murmur) may indicate a heart problem. Murmurs that occur when the heart is emptying (systolic) generally are innocent heart murmurs that don't cause health issues, but sometimes they may reflect a heart condition. A chest X-ray shows an image of the heart, lungs and blood vessels. It can reveal if the heart is enlarged, which may mean an underlying condition is causing the heart murmur. In this noninvasive test, a technician will place probes on the chest that record the electrical impulses that make the heart beat. An ECG records these electrical signals and can help the doctor look for heart rhythm and structure problems. Echocardiography can help identify abnormal heart valves, such as those that are hardened (calcified) or leaking, and can also detect most heart defects.",,,"Depending on the heart condition, the doctor may recommend one of these options to treat a damaged or leaky valve: To repair a valve, the doctor may recommend one of the following procedures: In many cases, the valve has to be replaced. If one receive a mechanical valve, one will need to take an anticoagulant medication, such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), for life to prevent blood clots. Tissue valves which may come from a pig, cow or human deceased donor often eventually need replacement. In some cases, a valve can be inserted via a catheter into a tissue replacement valve that needs to be replaced (valve-in-valve procedure). Doctors no longer recommend antibiotics before procedures, except for people at highest risk of complications of infective endocarditis, such as those who have an artificial heart valve or people with certain congenital heart defects. Having high cholesterol seems to worsen some heart valve problems, including some heart murmurs. During a balloon valvuloplasty, a small catheter containing an expandable balloon is threaded into the heart, placed into the valve and then expanded to help widen the narrowed valve. In this procedure, the surgeon replaces or shortens the cords that support the valves (chordae tendineae and papillary muscles) to repair the structural support. In valve leaflet repair, the surgeon surgically separates, cuts or pleats a valve flap (leaflet).",Cardiology,Whooshing,,,"Insufficiency, regurgitation, stenosis",,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg

Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke. In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, the skin will feel hot and dry to the touch. However, in heatstroke brought on by strenuous exercise, the skin may feel dry or slightly moist. The pulse may significantly increase because heat stress places a tremendous burden on the heart to help cool the body.","Heatstroke is a condition caused by the body overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures. This most serious form of heat injury, heatstroke, can occur if the body temperature rises to 104 F (40 C) or higher.","In a type of heatstroke, called nonexertional (classic) heatstroke, being in a hot environment leads to a rise in core body temperature.

Be especially careful in hot weather if one take medications that narrow the blood vessels (vasoconstrictors), regulate the blood pressure by blocking adrenaline (beta blockers), rid the body of sodium and water (diuretics), or reduce psychiatric symptoms (antidepressants or antipsychotics).

In most cases, the body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts. When warts do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which kind of HPV is involved: Genital warts. In women, genital warts appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender. Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers. In most cases, common warts are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding. Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of the feet.","HPV infection is a viral infection that commonly causes skin or mucous membrane growths (warts). Other types of cancers, including cancers of the anus, penis, vagina, vulva and back of the throat (oropharyngeal), have been linked to HPV infection.","Genital HPV infections are contracted through sexual intercourse, anal sex and other skin-to-skin contact in the genital region. If one is pregnant and have an HPV infection with genital warts, it's possible the baby may get the infection.",Risk factors for HPV infection include Number of sexual partners. People who have weakened immune systems are at greater risk of HPV infections. Touching someone's warts or not wearing protection before contacting surfaces that have been exposed to HPV such as public showers or swimming pools might increase the risk of HPV infection.,"If genital warts aren't visible, one will need one or more of the following tests: Vinegar (acetic acid) solution test. This test, conducted on cells from the cervix, can recognize the DNA of the high-risk varieties of HPV that have been linked to genital cancers. Pap smear Vinegar (acetic acid) solution test.",,,"Examples include If medications don't work, the doctor might suggest removing warts by one of these methods: If one has an abnormal HPV or Pap test, the gynecologist will perform a procedure called a colposcopy. Using an instrument that provides a magnified view of the cervix (colposcope), the doctor will look closely at the cervix and take samples (biopsy) of any areas that look abnormal. Options include freezing (cryosurgery), laser, surgical removal, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and cold knife conization. LEEP uses a thin looped wire charged with an electric current to remove a thin layer of a section of the cervix and cold knife conization is a surgical procedure that removes a cone-shaped piece of the cervix.

Hypercalcemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypercalcemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355523,"More-severe cases produce signs and symptoms related to the parts of the body affected by the high calcium levels in the blood. Examples include Contact the doctor if one develop signs and symptoms that might indicate hypercalcemia, such as being extremely thirsty, urinating frequently and having abdominal pain. Hypercalcemia can cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting and constipation. In most cases, the excess calcium in the blood was leached from the bones, which weakens them. Hypercalcemia can interfere with how the brain works, resulting in confusion, lethargy and fatigue. Rarely, severe hypercalcemia can interfere with the heart function, causing palpitations and fainting, indications of cardiac arrhythmia, and other heart problems.","The parathyroid glands, which lie behind the thyroid, manufacture the parathyroid hormone, which plays a role in regulating the body's levels of the minerals calcium and phosphorus. Other causes of hypercalcemia include cancer, certain other medical disorders, some medications, and taking too much of calcium and vitamin D supplements.","Besides building strong bones and teeth, calcium helps muscles contract and nerves transmit signals. This most common cause of hypercalcemia can stem from a small, noncancerous (benign) tumor or enlargement of one or more of the four parathyroid glands. Lung cancer and breast cancer, as well as some blood cancers, can increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Certain diseases, such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis, can raise blood levels of vitamin D, which stimulates the digestive tract to absorb more calcium. A rare genetic disorder known as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia causes an increase of calcium in the blood because of faulty calcium receptors in the body. Over time, bones that don't bear weight release calcium into the blood. Certain drugs such as lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder might increase the release of parathyroid hormone. Taking excessive amounts of calcium or vitamin D supplements over time can raise calcium levels in the blood above normal.",,,,,"In some cases, the doctor might recommend: Problems associated with overactive parathyroid glands often can be cured by surgery to remove the tissue that's causing the problem. Intravenous osteoporosis drugs, which can quickly lower calcium levels, are often used to treat hypercalcemia due to cancer.

Foods that are high in cholesterol, such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, will also increase the cholesterol. Exercise helps boost the body's HDL, or good, cholesterol while increasing the size of the particles that make up the LDL, or bad, cholesterol, which makes it less harmful.

It's also possible to develop Cushing syndrome from injectable corticosteroids for example, repeated injections for joint pain, bursitis and back pain. The condition may also be due to the body's own overproduction of cortisol (endogenous Cushing syndrome). This may occur from excess production by one or both adrenal glands, or overproduction of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which normally regulates cortisol production. Cancerous tumors of the adrenal cortex (adrenocortical carcinomas) are rare, but they can cause Cushing syndrome as well. Rarely, a tumor that develops in an organ that normally does not produce ACTH will begin to secrete this hormone in excess, resulting in Cushing syndrome. Rarely, people inherit a tendency to develop tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, affecting cortisol levels and causing Cushing syndrome.",,"He or she may suspect Cushing syndrome if one has signs such as rounding of the face (moon face), a pad of fatty tissue between the shoulders and neck (buffalo hump), and thin skin with bruises and stretch marks. If one has been taking a corticosteroid medication for a long time, the doctor may suspect that one has developed Cushing syndrome as a result of this medication. These tests help the doctor diagnose Cushing syndrome, and they may help rule out other medical conditions with similar signs and symptoms. For example, polycystic ovary syndrome a hormone disorder in women with enlarged ovaries shares some of the same signs and symptoms as Cushing syndrome, such as excessive hair growth and irregular menstrual periods. By analyzing cortisol levels from a small sample of saliva collected late at night, doctors can see if cortisol levels are too high, suggesting a diagnosis of Cushing syndrome.",,"One didn't develop Cushing syndrome overnight, and the symptoms won't disappear overnight, either. Nutritious, wholesome foods provide a good source of fuel for the recovering body and can help one lose the extra pounds that one gained from Cushing syndrome.

Sometimes pregnancy contributes to high blood pressure, as well. Although high blood pressure is most common in adults, children may be at risk, too. For some children, high blood pressure is caused by problems with the kidneys or heart. But for a growing number of kids, poor lifestyle habits, such as an unhealthy diet, obesity and lack of exercise, contribute to high blood pressure. Until about age 64, high blood pressure is more common in men. High blood pressure is particularly common among people of African heritage, often developing at an earlier age than it does in whites. As the volume of blood circulated through the blood vessels increases, so does the pressure on the artery walls. Not only does smoking or chewing tobacco immediately raise the blood pressure temporarily, but the chemicals in tobacco can damage the lining of the artery walls. Too much sodium in the diet can cause the body to retain fluid, which increases blood pressure. If one try to relax by eating more, using tobacco or drinking alcohol, one may only increase problems with high blood pressure. Certain chronic conditions also may increase the risk of high blood pressure, such as kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea.","A blood pressure reading, as shown in the blood pressure monitor in the image, measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats (systolic pressure) in the first number, and the pressure in the arteries between heartbeats (diastolic pressure) in the second number.

Eating a heart-healthy diet with less salt Getting regular physical activity Maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if one is overweight or obese Limiting the amount of alcohol one drink One is a healthy adult age 65 or older One is a healthy adult younger than age 65 with a 10 percent or higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years One has chronic kidney disease, diabetes or coronary artery disease","Lifestyle changes can help one control and prevent high blood pressure, even if one is taking blood pressure medication. Regular physical activity can help lower the blood pressure, manage stress, reduce the risk of several health problems and keep the weight under control. Home blood pressure monitoring can help one keep closer tabs on the blood pressure, show if medication is working, and even alert one and the doctor to potential complications. Home blood pressure monitoring isn't a substitute for visits to the doctor, and home blood pressure monitors may have some limitations. If the blood pressure is under control, check with the doctor about how often one need to check it. Get plenty of potassium, which can help prevent and control high blood pressure. Keeping a healthy weight, or losing weight if one is overweight or obese, can help one control the high blood pressure and lower the risk of related health problems. In general, one may reduce the blood pressure by about 1 mm Hg with each kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) of weight one lose. Even if one is healthy, alcohol can raise the blood pressure. According to the American Heart Association, device-guided breathing may be a reasonable nondrug option for lowering blood pressure, especially when anxiety accompanies high blood pressure or standard treatments aren't well-tolerated. If one is a woman with high blood pressure, discuss with the doctor how to control the blood pressure during pregnancy.","Thiazide diuretics are often the first, but not the only, choice in high blood pressure medications. If one is not taking a diuretic and the blood pressure remains high, talk to the doctor about adding one or replacing a drug one currently take with a diuretic. These medications including amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and others help relax the muscles of the blood vessels. If one is having trouble reaching the blood pressure goal with combinations of the above medications, the doctor may prescribe: Beta blockers. Beta blockers aren't usually recommended as the only medication one is prescribed, but they may be effective when combined with other blood pressure medications. Aliskiren (Tekturna) slows down the production of renin, an enzyme produced by the kidneys that starts a chain of chemical steps that increases blood pressure. If the blood pressure remains stubbornly high despite taking at least three different types of high blood pressure drugs, one of which usually should be a diuretic, one may have resistant hypertension. In fact, if one and the doctor can identify what's behind the persistently high blood pressure, there's a good chance one can meet the goal with the help of treatment that's more effective. If one don't take the high blood pressure medications exactly as directed, the blood pressure can pay the price. These medications such as lisinopril (Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten) and others help relax blood vessels by blocking the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. Evaluate potential causes of the condition and determine if those can be treated Review medications one is taking for other conditions and recommend one not take any that worsen the blood pressure Recommend that one monitor the blood pressure at home to see if one may have higher blood pressure in the doctor's office (white coat hypertension) Suggest healthy lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet with less salt, maintaining a healthy weight and limiting how much alcohol one drink Make changes to the high blood pressure medications to come up with the most effective combination and doses Consider adding an aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone (Aldactone), which may lead to control of resistant hypertension Thiazide diuretics.",Cardiology,None,,,Usually lifestyle and genetic factors,"Lack of sleep, Excess salt, excess body weight, smoking, alcohol Air Pollution",Resting blood pressureÂ 130/80 or 140/90Â mmHg,,"Lifestyle changes, medications",,16â€“37% globally,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Blausen_0486_HighBloodPressure_01.png

Also called bowel incontinence, fecal incontinence ranges from an occasional leakage of stool while passing gas to a complete loss of bowel control.","Injury to the rings of muscle at the end of the rectum (anal sphincter) may make it difficult to hold stool back properly. Injury to the nerves that sense stool in the rectum or those that control the anal sphincter can lead to fecal incontinence. The nerve damage can be caused by childbirth, constant straining during bowel movements, spinal cord injury or stroke. Some diseases, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, also can affect these nerves and cause damage that leads to fecal incontinence. Chronic constipation may cause a dry, hard mass of stool (impacted stool) to form in the rectum and become too large to pass. Chronic constipation may also cause nerve damage that leads to fecal incontinence. Solid stool is easier to retain in the rectum than is loose stool, so the loose stools of diarrhea can cause or worsen fecal incontinence. When the veins in the rectum swell, causing hemorrhoids, this keeps the anus from closing completely, which can allow stool to leak out. Fecal incontinence can be a result of this condition, in which the rectum drops down into the anus. In women, fecal incontinence can occur if the rectum protrudes through the vagina.","A number of factors may increase the risk of developing fecal incontinence, including Age. People who have long-standing diabetes or multiple sclerosis conditions that can damage nerves that help control defecation may be at risk of fecal incontinence. An injury that caused a physical disability also may cause rectal nerve damage, leading to fecal incontinence.",,,"Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder and bowel and, in women, the uterus, and may help reduce incontinence. As the muscles strengthen, hold the contraction longer, gradually working the way up to three sets of 10 contractions every day. Foods that can cause diarrhea or gas and worsen fecal incontinence include spicy foods, fatty and greasy foods, and dairy products (if one is lactose intolerant). When medical treatments can't completely eliminate incontinence, products such as absorbent pads and disposable underwear can help one manage the problem. If one use pads or adult diapers, be sure they have an absorbent wicking layer on top, to help keep moisture away from the skin.

Infectious diseases commonly spread through the direct transfer of bacteria, viruses or other germs from one person to another. The person who passes the germ may have no symptoms of the disease, but may simply be a carrier. Some germs rely on insect carriers such as mosquitoes, fleas, lice or ticks to move from host to host. Escherichia coli (E. coli), for example, is a bacterium present in or on certain foods such as undercooked hamburger or unpasteurized fruit juice. Even smaller than bacteria, viruses cause a multitude of diseases ranging from the common cold to AIDS. Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, are caused by fungi. Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal even a pet can make one sick and, in extreme circumstances, can be fatal.

If one is older than 40, the doctor may want to begin testing or treatment right away.",,"The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix and vagina (vaginal canal) make up the female reproductive system. Fertilization and implantation During fertilization, the sperm and egg unite in one of the fallopian tubes to form a zygote. Problems with the regulation of reproductive hormones by the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, or problems in the ovary, can cause ovulation disorders. Damaged or blocked fallopian tubes keep sperm from getting to the egg or block the passage of the fertilized egg into the uterus. Causes of fallopian tube damage or blockage can include Endometriosis occurs when tissue that normally grows in the uterus implants and grows in other locations. This extra tissue growth and the surgical removal of it can cause scarring, which may block fallopian tubes and keep an egg and sperm from uniting. Endometriosis can also affect the lining of the uterus, disrupting implantation of the fertilized egg. The condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways, such as damage to the sperm or egg. Several uterine or cervical causes can impact fertility by interfering with implantation or increasing the likelihood of a miscarriage: Sometimes, the cause of infertility is never found. The egg and sperm meet in the fallopian tubes, and the embryo needs a healthy uterus in which to grow. Sperm swim up the cervix, through the uterus and into the fallopian tube to reach the egg for fertilization. The pituitary gland may cause excess production of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia), which reduces estrogen production and may cause infertility. Some can block fallopian tubes or interfere with implantation, affecting fertility. Uterine abnormalities present from birth, such as an abnormally shaped uterus, can cause problems becoming or remaining pregnant.","Certain factors may put one at higher risk of infertility, including Age. Besides damaging the cervix and fallopian tubes, smoking increases the risk of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. Having unprotected intercourse with multiple partners increases the risk of a sexually transmitted infection that may cause fertility problems later.","Fertility tests may include Depending on the situation, rarely the testing may include Ovulation testing. During hysterosalpingography (his-tur-o-sal-ping-GOG-ruh-fee), X-ray contrast is injected into the uterus and an X-ray is taken to detect abnormalities in the uterine cavity. Depending on the symptoms, the doctor may request a hysteroscopy to look for uterine or fallopian tube disease.

Although inflammatory bowel disease usually isn't fatal, it's a serious disease that, in some cases, may cause life-threatening complications.","Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohn's disease most commonly affects the colon and the last part of the small intestine (ileum). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an umbrella term used to describe disorders that involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract. Types of IBD include Both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease usually involve severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss.",,"Although whites have the highest risk of the disease, it can occur in any race. One is at higher risk if one has a close relative such as a parent, sibling or child with the disease. Although smoking may provide some protection against ulcerative colitis, the overall health benefits of not smoking make it important to try to quit. These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium (Voltaren) and others. These medications may increase the risk of developing IBD or worsen disease in people who have IBD.","To help confirm a diagnosis of IBD, one may have one or more of the following tests and procedures: During a colonoscopy, the doctor inserts a colonoscope into the rectum to check for abnormalities in the entire colon. During a flexible sigmoidoscopy exam, the doctor inserts a sigmoidoscope into the rectum to check for abnormalities in the sigmoid colon and most of the descending colon. The doctor may suggest blood tests to check for anemia a condition in which there aren't enough red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the tissues or to check for signs of infection from bacteria or viruses. This exam allows the doctor to view the entire colon using a thin, flexible, lighted tube with an attached camera. During the procedure, the doctor can also take small samples of tissue (biopsy) for laboratory analysis. The doctor uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the rectum and sigmoid, the last portion of the colon. If the colon is severely inflamed, the doctor may perform this test instead of a full colonoscopy. In this procedure, the doctor uses a slender, flexible, lighted tube to examine the esophagus, stomach and first part of the small intestine (duodenum). While it is rare for these areas to be involved with Crohn's disease, this test may be recommended if one is having nausea and vomiting, difficulty eating or upper abdominal pain. If one has severe symptoms, the doctor may use a standard X-ray of the abdominal area to rule out serious complications, such as a perforated colon.",,"If one has inflammatory bowel disease, high-fiber foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains, may make the symptoms worse. In general, one may have more problems with foods in the cabbage family, such as broccoli and cauliflower, and nuts, seeds, corn and popcorn. Smoking increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease, and once one has it, smoking can make it worse. The association of stress with Crohn's disease is controversial, but many people who have the disease report symptom flares during high-stress periods. Many people with inflammatory bowel disease find that problems such as diarrhea, abdominal pain and gas improve by limiting or eliminating dairy products. One may be lactose intolerant that is, the body can't digest the milk sugar (lactose) in dairy foods. If one has Crohn's disease of the small intestine, one may not be able to digest or absorb fat normally. Spicy foods, alcohol and caffeine may make the signs and symptoms worse. Because Crohn's disease can interfere with the ability to absorb nutrients and because the diet may be limited, multivitamin and mineral supplements are often helpful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Associatedloci.png

These signs and symptoms include If one has these signs or symptoms, or if an initial treatment for IBS doesn't work, one will likely need additional tests. The doctor may recommend several tests, including stool studies to check for infection or problems with the intestine's ability to take in the nutrients from food (malabsorption). These criteria include abdominal pain and discomfort lasting on average at least one day a week in the last three months, associated with at least two of these factors: Pain and discomfort are related to defecation, the frequency of defecation is altered, or stool consistency is altered. Onset of signs and symptoms after age 50 Weight loss Rectal bleeding Fever Nausea or recurrent vomiting Abdominal pain, especially if it's not completely relieved by a bowel movement, or occurs at night Diarrhea that is persistent or awakens one from sleep Anemia related to low iron Flexible sigmoidoscopy. The doctor examines the lower part of the colon (sigmoid) with a flexible, lighted tube (sigmoidoscope). These tests produce images of the abdomen and pelvis that might allow the doctor to rule out other causes of the symptoms, especially if one has abdominal pain. The stool might be examined for bacteria or parasites, or a digestive liquid produced in the liver (bile acid), if one has chronic diarrhea.","If the problems are moderate or severe, the doctor might suggest counseling especially if one has depression or if stress tends to worsen the symptoms. In addition, based on the symptoms the doctor might suggest medications such as: Avoid foods that trigger the symptoms Eat high-fiber foods Drink plenty of fluids Exercise regularly Get enough sleep High-gas foods. Research shows that some people with IBS report improvement in diarrhea symptoms if they stop eating gluten (wheat, barley and rye) even if they don't have celiac disease. If fiber doesn't help symptoms, the doctor may prescribe magnesium hydroxide oral (Phillips Milk of Magnesia) or polyethylene glycol (Miralax). Over-the-counter medications, such as loperamide (Imodium), can help control diarrhea. The doctor might also prescribe a bile acid binder, such as cholestyramine (Prevalite), colestipol (Colestid) or colesevelam (Welchol). If one has diarrhea and abdominal pain without depression, the doctor may suggest a lower than normal dose of imipramine (Tofranil), desipramine (Norpramine) or nortriptyline (Pamelor). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) or paroxetine (Paxil), may help if one is depressed and have pain and constipation.","Try slowly increasing the amount of fiber in the diet over a period of weeks with foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables and beans. Don't skip meals, and try to eat at about the same time each day to help regulate bowel function. If one has diarrhea, one may find that eating small, frequent meals makes one feel better. But if one is constipated, eating larger amounts of high-fiber foods may help move food through the intestines. Exercise helps relieve depression and stress, stimulates normal contractions of the intestines, and can help one feel better about theself.","Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI), a nutritional therapy, has shown some promise as a treatment for IBS with diarrhea. Studies also show that, in people who have IBS with diarrhea, a specially coated tablet that slowly releases peppermint oil in the small intestine (enteric-coated peppermint oil) eases bloating, urgency, abdominal pain and pain while passing stool. Alosetron can be prescribed only by doctors enrolled in a special program, is intended for severe cases of diarrhea-predominant IBS in women who haven't responded to other treatments, and isn't approved for use by men.

Some of the more common knee injuries include Some examples of mechanical problems that can cause knee pain include More than 100 different types of arthritis exist. The bones of the knee, including the kneecap (patella), can be broken during motor vehicle collisions or falls. This occurs when the triangular bone (patella) that covers the front of the knee slips out of place, usually to the outside of the knee. In some cases, problems in the hip or foot can cause knee pain. The most debilitating form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can affect almost any joint in the body, including the knees. Sometimes the knee joint can become infected, leading to swelling, pain and redness. Septic arthritis often occurs with a fever, and there's usually no trauma before the onset of pain.","Being overweight or obese increases stress on the knee joints, even during ordinary activities such as walking or going up and down stairs. Alpine skiing with its rigid ski boots and potential for falls, basketball's jumps and pivots, and the repeated pounding the knees take when one run or jog all increase the risk of knee injury.","During the physical exam, the doctor is likely to: In some cases, the doctor might suggest tests such as: If the doctor suspects an infection or inflammation, one is likely to have blood tests and sometimes a procedure called arthrocentesis, in which a small amount of fluid is removed from within the knee joint with a needle and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Inspect the knee for swelling, pain, tenderness, warmth and visible bruising Check to see how far one can move the lower leg in different directions Push on or pull the joint to evaluate the integrity of the structures in the knee X-ray. The doctor may first recommend having an X-ray, which can help detect bone fractures and degenerative joint disease.",,"Over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) may help ease knee pain. Some people find relief by rubbing the affected knee with creams containing a numbing agent, such as lidocaine, or capsaicin, the substance that makes chili peppers hot. Take a break from the normal activities to reduce repetitive strain on the knee, give the injury time to heal and help prevent further damage. Although ice therapy is generally safe and effective, don't use ice for longer than 20 minutes at a time because of the risk of damage to the nerves and skin.","If one is physically active or practice a sport, one may need exercises to correct movement patterns that may be affecting the knees and to establish good technique during the sport or activity. In certain conditions, different types of braces may be used to help protect and support the knee joint. Depending on the injury, the doctor may be able to examine and repair the joint damage using a fiber-optic camera and long, narrow tools inserted through just a few small incisions around the knee. Arthroscopy may be used to remove loose bodies from the knee joint, remove or repair damaged cartilage (especially if it is causing the knee to lock), and reconstruct torn ligaments.

But in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells, which don't function properly.","In general, leukemia is thought to occur when some blood cells acquire mutations in their DNA the instructions inside each cell that guide its action. In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are immature blood cells (blasts). This type of leukemia affects the lymphoid cells (lymphocytes), which form lymphoid or lymphatic tissue. With CLL, the most common chronic adult leukemia, one may feel well for years without needing treatment.","Factors that may increase the risk of developing some types of leukemia include However, most people with known risk factors don't get leukemia. People whove had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other cancers have an increased risk of developing certain types of leukemia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of leukemia. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene which is found in gasoline and is used by the chemical industry is linked to an increased risk of some kinds of leukemia. If members of the family have been diagnosed with leukemia, the risk of the disease may be increased.","In a bone marrow aspiration, a doctor or nurse uses a thin needle to remove a small amount of liquid bone marrow, usually from a spot in the back of the hipbone (pelvis). By looking at a sample of the blood, the doctor can determine if one has abnormal levels of red or white blood cells or platelets which may suggest leukemia.","One may receive radiation in one specific area of the body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or one may receive radiation over the whole body. Before a stem cell transplant, one receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy the diseased bone marrow. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells.Depending on the type of leukemia one has, one may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within the cancer cells.For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. During radiation therapy, one lie on a table while a large machine moves around one, directing the radiation to precise points on the body.One may receive radiation in one specific area of the body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or one may receive radiation over the whole body. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace the diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow.Before a stem cell transplant, one receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy the diseased bone marrow. Then one receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild the bone marrow.One may receive stem cells from a donor, or in some cases one may be able to use the own stem cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Acute_leukemia-ALL.jpg

Some people are born with a genetic mutation that causes long QT syndrome (congenital long QT syndrome). Long QT syndrome may be caused by certain medications, mineral imbalances or medical conditions (acquired long QT syndrome).","Long QT syndrome is a heart rhythm disorder caused by abnormalities in the heart's electrical recharging system. In long QT syndrome, the heart's electrical system takes longer than normal to recharge between beats. Long QT syndrome is often grouped into two main categories, depending on the cause.

Medications that can cause acquired long QT syndrome include If the condition is caused by a medication, it may be called drug-induced long QT syndrome. Other causes of acquired long QT syndrome include If one is born with the condition, it's called congenital long QT syndrome. If an underlying medical condition or medication causes it, it's called acquired long QT syndrome.",,"To diagnose long QT syndrome, the doctor will perform a physical exam and ask questions about the or the child's symptoms and medical and family history. During an ECG, sticky patches (electrodes) are placed on the chest to record the heart's electrical signals, which cause the heart to beat. The test labels the heart's electrical signals as five waves using the letters P, Q, R, S and T. The waves labeled Q through T show the electrical activity in the heart's lower chambers (ventricles). If the interval takes longer than normal to occur, it's called a prolonged QT interval. If the long QT symptoms tend to come and go, they may not be captured during a standard ECG recording. It's important to understand that genetic tests for long QT syndrome can't detect all inherited cases of long QT syndrome. If one has a positive genetic test for long QT syndrome, the doctor may recommend that other family members also be tested to determine whether they inherited the same gene.","Treatment for long QT syndrome involves lifestyle changes, medications, and possibly surgery or other procedures.

Some types of low blood pressure include Low blood pressure on standing up (orthostatic or postural) hypotension). But in people with orthostatic hypotension, this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision and even fainting. Ordinarily, the body increases the heart rate and constricts certain blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure. Because the circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy, blood pressure is likely to drop. This is normal, and blood pressure usually returns to the pre-pregnancy level after one has given birth. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure. When an infection in the body enters the bloodstream, it can lead to a life-threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock. Anaphylaxis can cause breathing problems, hives, itching, a swollen throat and a dangerous drop in blood pressure. A lack of the vitamin B-12, folate and iron can keep the body from producing enough red blood cells (anemia), causing low blood pressure. This disorder, which causes a blood pressure drop after standing for long periods, mostly affects young adults and children. Low blood pressure due to nervous system damage (multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension). It causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing and digestion.","Low blood pressure (hypotension) can occur in anyone, though certain types of low blood pressure are more common depending on the age or other factors: Age. People who take certain medications, for example, high blood pressure medications such as alpha blockers, have a greater risk of low blood pressure. Parkinson's disease, diabetes and some heart conditions put one at a greater risk of developing low blood pressure.","During this test, the heart rate and blood pressure are monitored to evaluate the body's cardiovascular response to the change in position. If one has low blood pressure on standing or from faulty brain signals (neurally mediated hypotension), a tilt table test can evaluate how the body reacts to changes in position. During the test, one lie on a table that's tilted to raise the upper part of the body, which simulates the movement from horizontal to a standing position. These can provide information about the overall health as well as whether one has low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), high blood sugar (hyperglycemia or diabetes) or a low red blood cell count (anemia), all of which can cause lower than normal blood pressure.

If one has diabetes, one might not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or one might be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause the blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can also occur if one eat less than usual after taking diabetes medication, or if one exercise more than one normally do. Kidney disorders, which can keep the body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as can occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in too little of substances the body needs to create glucose. Sometimes hypoglycemia symptoms occur after certain meals high in sugar because the body produces more insulin than one need. Other medications can cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. Drinking heavily without eating can block the liver from releasing stored glucose into the bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) can cause one to produce too much insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia.

If the lack of interest in sex continues or returns and causes personal distress, one may have a condition called sexual interest/arousal disorder. If one is bothered by a low sex drive or decreased sex drive, there are lifestyle changes and sexual techniques that may put one in the mood more often.","If one is experiencing a problem in any of these areas, it can affect the desire for sex. There are many psychological causes of low sex drive, including For many women, emotional closeness is an essential prelude to sexual intimacy. Decreased interest in sex is often a result of ongoing issues, such as: Sexual problems. Many nonsexual diseases can affect sex drive, including arthritis, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and neurological diseases. Certain prescription drugs, especially antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are known to lower the sex drive. A glass of wine may put one in the mood, but too much alcohol can affect the sex drive. Any surgery related to the breasts or genital tract can affect the body image, sexual function and desire for sex. This can make one less interested in sex and cause dry vaginal tissues, resulting in painful or uncomfortable sex. Although many women still have satisfying sex during menopause and beyond, some experience a lagging libido during this hormonal change. Hormone changes during pregnancy, just after having a baby and during breast-feeding can put a damper on sex drive. Fatigue, changes in body image, and the pressures of pregnancy or caring for a new baby also can contribute to changes in the sexual desire.",,"By definition, one may be diagnosed with hypoactive sexual desire disorder if one frequently lack sexual thoughts or desire, and the absence of these feelings causes personal distress. In addition to asking one questions about the medical and sexual history, the doctor may also: Perform a pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, the doctor can check for signs of physical changes contributing to low sexual desire, such as thinning of the genital tissues, vaginal dryness or pain-triggering spots.",,"Finding a better way to cope with work stress, financial stress and daily hassles can enhance the sex drive. Couples who learn to communicate in an open, honest way usually maintain a stronger emotional connection, which can lead to better sex. Try a different sexual position, a different time of day or a different location for sex. If one and the partner are open to experimentation, sex toys and fantasy can help rekindle the sexual desire. Ditching these bad habits may help give the sex drive a boost and improve the overall health.","For example, antidepressants such as paroxetine (Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) may lower sex drive. Switching to bupropion (Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL) a different type of antidepressant usually improves sex drive and is sometimes prescribed for women with sexual interest/arousal disorder. Dryness or shrinking of the vagina, one of the hallmark signs of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), might make sex uncomfortable and, in turn, reduce the desire.

Low sperm count,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/low-sperm-count/symptoms-causes/syc-20374585,,,"Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis. Also, there can be problems of abnormal sperm shape (morphology), movement (motility) or function. However, often the cause of low sperm count isn't identified. Various health conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation or lack of ejaculation, including diabetes, spinal injuries, and surgery of the bladder, prostate or urethra. In most cases of permanent ejaculation problems, sperm can still be retrieved directly from the testicles. Sperm production or function can be affected by overexposure to certain environmental elements, including Overheating the testicles. Elevated temperatures impair sperm production and function.Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs might temporarily impair sperm count. Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it might be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation. These include inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) or testicles (orchitis) and some sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea or HIV. Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved. The hypothalamus, pituitary and testicles produce hormones that are necessary to create sperm. Alterations in these hormones, as well as from other systems such as the thyroid and adrenal gland, may impair sperm production. In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockages or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles. Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead might contribute to low sperm counts. With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced. Anabolic steroids taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. Certain occupations might be linked with a risk of infertility, including welding or those associated with prolonged sitting, such as truck driving. Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including stress about fertility, might interfere with hormones needed to produce sperm. Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm and by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.",,"Even if the doctor thinks low sperm count is the problem, it is recommended that the partner be evaluated to rule out potential contributing factors and determine if assisted reproductive techniques may be required. To ensure accuracy in a collection, the doctor will: Normal sperm densities range from 15 million to greater than 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen. There are many factors involved in reproduction, and the number of sperm in the semen is only one. Even if one has enough sperm, other factors are important to achieve a pregnancy, including normal sperm movement (motility). Depending on initial findings, the doctor might recommend additional tests to look for the cause of the low sperm count and other possible causes of male infertility. These can include Ask one to make sure all of the semen makes it into the collection cup or collection condom when one ejaculate Have one abstain from ejaculating for at least two but no longer than 11 days before collecting a sample Collect a second sample at least two weeks after the first Have one avoid the use of lubricants because these products can affect sperm motility Scrotal ultrasound. The doctor might recommend a blood test to determine the level of hormones produced by the pituitary gland and testicles, which play a key role in sexual development and sperm production. These tests, which are used to check for immune cells (antibodies) that attack sperm and affect their ability to function, are not common. A number of tests can be used to check how well the sperm survive after ejaculation, how well they can penetrate an egg and whether there's any problem attaching to the egg.","In cases where no sperm are present in the ejaculate, sperm can often be retrieved directly from the testicles or epididymis using sperm retrieval techniques. The doctor might recommend hormone replacement or medications in cases where infertility is caused by high or low levels of certain hormones or problems with the way the body uses hormones. ART treatments involve obtaining sperm through normal ejaculation, surgical extraction or from donor individuals, depending on the specific situation and wishes.","There are steps one can take at home to increase the chances of getting the partner pregnant, including Increasing the frequency of sex.

Drugs given during surgery make one breathe less deeply, so normal secretions collect in the airways. Suctioning the lungs during surgery helps clear them, but sometimes they still build up. Atelectasis is common in children who have inhaled an object, such as a peanut or small toy part, into their lungs. This condition involves the buildup of fluid between the tissues (pleura) that line the lungs and the inside of the chest wall. Various types of pneumonia, a lung infection, can cause atelectasis.

Interstitial lung disease can be triggered by many different things including airborne toxins in the workplace, drugs and some types of medical treatments. Drugs designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Otrexup, Trexall, others) and cyclophosphamide, can also damage lung tissue. Some drugs used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Nexterone, Pacerone) or propranolol (Inderal, Innopran), may harm lung tissue. Nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin, others) and ethambutol (Myambutol) can cause lung damage. Certain anti-inflammatory drugs, such as rituximab (Rituxan) or sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), can cause lung damage.","Interstitial lung disease is much more likely to affect adults, although infants and children sometimes develop the disorder. If one work in mining, farming or construction or for any reason are exposed to pollutants known to damage the lungs, the risk of interstitial lung disease is increased.

Some forms of interstitial lung disease are more likely to occur in people with a history of smoking, and active smoking may make the condition worse, especially if there is associated emphysema.","In addition, the signs and symptoms of a wide range of medical conditions can mimic interstitial lung disease, and doctors must rule these out before making a definitive diagnosis. Often, pulmonary fibrosis can be definitively diagnosed only by examining a small amount of lung tissue (biopsy) in a laboratory. This imaging test is key to, and sometimes the first step in, the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease. This test requires one to exhale quickly and forcefully through a tube connected to a machine that measures how much air the lungs can hold, and how quickly one can move air out of the lungs. In this procedure, the doctor removes very small tissue samples generally no larger than the head of a pin using a small, flexible tube (bronchoscope) that's passed through the mouth or nose into the lungs. Although bronchoalveolar lavage samples a larger area of the lung than other procedures do, it may not provide enough information to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis.

He or she may then have one undergo tests and procedures used to diagnose Hodgkin's lymphoma, including Other tests and procedures may be used depending on the situation. After the doctor has determined the extent of the Hodgkin's lymphoma, the cancer will be assigned a stage. Stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma include Additionally, the doctor uses the letters A and B to indicate whether one is experiencing symptoms of Hodgkin's lymphoma: Many types of Hodgkin's lymphoma exist, including rare forms that are difficult for inexperienced pathologists to identify. The doctor may recommend imaging tests to look for signs of Hodgkin's lymphoma in other areas of the body. He or she will diagnose classical Hodgkin's lymphoma if abnormal cells called Reed-Sternberg cells are found within the lymph node. In this stage, the cancer is in two lymph node regions or the cancer has invaded one organ and the nearby lymph nodes. When the cancer moves to lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm, it's considered stage III. Stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma affects not only the lymph nodes but also other parts of the body, such as the liver, lungs or bones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Mantle_cell_lymphoma_-_intermed_mag.jpg

Antidepressants aren't considered addictive, but sometimes physical dependence (which is different from addiction) can occur. If one is pregnant or breast-feeding, some antidepressants may pose an increased health risk to the unborn child or nursing child. Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires all antidepressants to carry a black box warning, the strictest warning for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under age 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. For some people, other procedures, sometimes called brain stimulation therapies, may be suggested: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft) and vilazodone (Viibryd). Examples of SNRIs include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and levomilnacipran (Fetzima).

But because men are born with a small amount of breast tissue, they can develop breast cancer. Types of breast cancer diagnosed in men include Some men inherit abnormal (mutated) genes from their parents that increase the risk of breast cancer. Mutations in one of several genes, especially a gene called BRCA2, put one at greater risk of developing breast and prostate cancers. Other, rarer types of breast cancer that can occur in men include Paget's disease of the nipple and inflammatory breast cancer.","If one take estrogen-related drugs, such as those used for hormone therapy for prostate cancer, the risk of breast cancer is increased. As a result, men with this syndrome produce lower levels of certain male hormones (androgens) and more female hormones (estrogens). Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can reduce male hormones and increase female hormones, increasing the risk of breast cancer. Obesity is associated with higher levels of estrogen in the body, which increases the risk of male breast cancer. Having inflamed testicles (orchitis) or surgery to remove a testicle (orchiectomy) can increase the risk of male breast cancer.","The doctor may conduct a number of diagnostic tests and procedures, such as: Removing a sample of breast cells for testing (biopsy).

Male infertility,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/male-infertility/symptoms-causes/syc-20374773,,,"To get the partner pregnant, the following must occur: Problems with male fertility can be caused by a number of health issues and medical treatments. Although the exact reason that varicoceles cause infertility is unknown, it may be related to abnormal testicular temperature regulation. Treating the varicocele can improve sperm numbers and function, and may potentially improve outcomes when using assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization. Some men with spinal cord injuries or certain diseases can't ejaculate semen, even though they still produce sperm. Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm production or sperm function. Although studies are limited and are inconclusive, frequent use of saunas or hot tubs may temporarily impair the sperm count. At least one of the testicles must be functioning correctly, and the body must produce testosterone and other hormones to trigger and maintain sperm production. Once sperm are produced in the testicles, delicate tubes transport them until they mix with semen and are ejaculated out of the penis. If the movement (motility) or function of the sperm is abnormal, the sperm may not be able to reach or penetrate the partner's egg. Although some infections can result in permanent testicular damage, most often sperm can still be retrieved. In some males, during fetal development one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the sac that normally contains the testicles (scrotum). Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves or an abnormality affecting other hormonal systems including the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands. A digestive disorder caused by sensitivity to gluten, celiac disease can cause male infertility. In most cases, surgery can be performed to either reverse these blockage or to retrieve sperm directly from the epididymis and testicles. Extended exposure to benzenes, toluene, xylene, pesticides, herbicides, organic solvents, painting materials and lead may contribute to low sperm counts. Exposure to radiation can reduce sperm production, though it will often eventually return to normal. With high doses of radiation, sperm production can be permanently reduced. Drinking alcohol can lower testosterone levels, cause erectile dysfunction and decrease sperm production. Severe or prolonged emotional stress, including problems with fertility, can affect the sperm count. In addition, depression in men may cause sexual dysfunction due to reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, or delayed or inhibited ejaculation. Obesity can impair fertility in several ways, including directly impacting sperm themselves as well as by causing hormone changes that reduce male fertility.",,"In most cases, several semen analysis tests are done over a period of time to ensure accurate results. If the sperm analysis is normal, the doctor will likely recommend thorough testing of the female partner before conducting any more male infertility tests. Hormones produced by the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and testicles play a key role in sexual development and sperm production. If the results of the testicular biopsy show that sperm production is normal, the problem is likely caused by a blockage or another problem with sperm transport. A number of tests can be used to check how well the sperm survive after ejaculation, how well they can penetrate an egg and whether there's any problem attaching to the egg.","Even if an exact cause isn't clear, the doctor might be able to recommend treatments or procedures that will result in conception. The doctor might recommend hormone replacement or medications in cases where infertility is caused by high or low levels of certain hormones or problems with the way the body uses hormones.

Because bacterial infections can be life-threatening, identifying the cause is essential. Several strains of bacteria can cause acute bacterial meningitis, most commonly: Viral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on its own. Most cases in the United States are caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, which are most common in late summer and early fall. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis. Slow-growing organisms (such as fungi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that invade the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain cause chronic meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease that affects people with immune deficiencies, such as AIDS. Meningitis can also result from noninfectious causes, such as chemical reactions, drug allergies, some types of cancer and inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis. This bacterium is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults in the United States. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacterium was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children.","College students living in dormitories, personnel on military bases, and children in boarding schools and child care facilities are at greater risk of meningococcal meningitis.

It can also include visual disturbances, such as flashes of light or blind spots, or other disturbances, such as tingling on one side of the face or in an arm or leg and difficulty speaking.","Though migraine causes aren't fully understood, genetics and environmental factors appear to play a role. Changes in the brainstem and its interactions with the trigeminal nerve, a major pain pathway, might be involved. Certain neurotransmitters play a role in the pain of migraine, including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). There are a number of migraine triggers, including Hormonal changes in women. Hormonal medications, such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, also can worsen migraines. Some women, however, find their migraines occurring less often when taking these medications. Bright lights and sun glare can induce migraines, as can loud sounds. Strong smells including perfume, paint thinner, secondhand smoke and others trigger migraines in some people. Missing sleep, getting too much sleep or jet lag can trigger migraines in some people. Intense physical exertion, including sexual activity, might provoke migraines. Oral contraceptives and vasodilators, such as nitroglycerin, can aggravate migraines.

The muscles used for chewing might wear out halfway through a meal, particularly if one has been eating something hard to chew, such as steak.","Myasthenia gravis (my-us-THEE-nee-uh GRAY-vis) is characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles under the voluntary control. There's no cure for myasthenia gravis, but treatment can help relieve signs and symptoms, such as weakness of arm or leg muscles, double vision, drooping eyelids, and difficulties with speech, chewing, swallowing and breathing.","In myasthenia gravis, certain receptor sites are blocked or destroyed, causing muscle weakness. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system produces antibodies that block or destroy many of the muscles receptor sites for a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (as-uh-teel-KOH-leen). Rarely, mothers with myasthenia gravis have children who are born with myasthenia gravis (neonatal myasthenia gravis).",,"The doctor might use several tests, including The doctor may check the neurological health by testing: Tests to help confirm a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis might include Injection of the chemical edrophonium chloride that results in a sudden, temporary improvement in muscle strength might indicate that one has myasthenia gravis. To diagnose myasthenia gravis, doctors will test the nerve repeatedly to see if its ability to send signals worsens with fatigue.",,"Also, try eating mainly soft foods and avoid foods that require more chewing, such as raw fruits or vegetables. Outside the home, keep paths, sidewalks and driveways cleared of leaves, snow and other debris that could cause one to stumble. To help one maintain the energy, try using an electric toothbrush, electric can openers and other electrical tools to perform tasks.","Medications such as pyridostigmine (Mestinon, Regonal) and neostigmine (Bloxiverz) enhance communication between nerves and muscles. The doctor might also prescribe other medications that alter the immune system, such as azathioprine (Azasan,, Imuran) mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept), cyclosporine (Sandimmune) methotrexate (Trexall) or tacrolimus (Astrograf XL, Prograf). If one has a tumor, called a thymoma, doctors will surgically remove the thymus gland (thymectomy). Even if one don't have a tumor in the thymus gland, removing the gland might improve the myasthenia gravis symptoms. In open surgery, the surgeon splits the central breastbone (sternum) to open the chest and remove the thymus gland. It might also involve: These procedures might cause less blood loss, less pain, lower mortality rates and shorter hospital stays compared with open surgery. Prolonged use of corticosteroids, however, can lead to serious side effects, such as bone thinning, weight gain, diabetes and increased risk of some infections. They then use a long, thin camera (video endoscope) and small instruments to see and remove the thymus gland. In this form of thymectomy, surgeons make several small incisions in the side of the chest and remove the thymus gland using a robotic system, which includes a camera arm and mechanical arms.",Neurology,"Varying degrees muscle weakness, double vision, drooping eyelids, trouble talking, trouble walking","Women under 40, men over 60",Long term,Autoimmune disease,,"Blood tests for specific antibodies, edrophonium test, nerve conduction studies",,"Medications, surgical removal of the thymus, plasmapheresis",,50 to 200 per million,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (neostigmine, pyridostigmine), immunosuppressants",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Azathioprine.svg
Myelodysplastic syndromes,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myelodysplastic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20366977,,Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells or ones that don't work properly. Myelodysplastic syndromes result from something amiss in the spongy material inside the bones where blood cells are made (bone marrow).,"The World Health Organization divides myelodysplastic syndromes into subtypes based on the type of blood cells red cells, white cells and platelets involved. One blood cell type white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets is low in number and appears abnormal under the microscope. People with this syndrome have low numbers of red blood cells, and the cells have a specific mutation in their DNA.","Chemotherapy or radiation therapy, both of which are commonly used to treat cancer, can increase the risk of myelodysplastic syndromes. Chemicals linked to myelodysplastic syndromes include tobacco smoke, pesticides and industrial chemicals, such as benzene.","In a bone marrow aspiration, a doctor or nurse uses a thin needle to remove a small amount of liquid bone marrow, usually from a spot in the back of the hipbone (pelvis). During a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, a thin needle is used to withdraw (aspirate) a small amount of liquid bone marrow, usually from a spot on the back of the hipbone.","Treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes most often targets slowing disease progression, managing symptoms, such as fatigue, and preventing bleeding and infections. If one has no symptoms, the doctor might recommend watchful waiting with regular exams and lab tests to see if the disease progresses.","Because people with certain myelodysplastic syndromes have low white blood cell counts, they're subject to recurrent, and often serious, infections. Wash hands frequently and thoroughly with warm, soapy water, especially before eating or preparing food. Avoid fruits and vegetables one can't peel, especially lettuce, and wash all produce one do use before peeling.","Some growth factors, such as epoetin alfa (Epogen, Procrit) or darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp), reduce the need for blood transfusions by increasing red blood cells. Others, such as filgrastim (Neupogen, Zarxio) might help prevent infections by increasing white blood cells in people with certain myelodysplastic syndromes. During a bone marrow transplant, also known as a stem cell transplant, high doses of chemotherapy drugs are used to clear out the defective blood cells from the bone marrow. Then the abnormal bone marrow stem cells are replaced with healthy, donated cells (allogeneic transplant). Medications such as azacitidine (Vidaza) and decitabine (Dacogen) might improve the quality of life of people with certain myelodysplastic syndromes and reduce the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia.

In a bone marrow biopsy, a needle is used to draw a sample of hardened bone marrow from the hipbone. During the same procedure, another type of needle may be used to withdraw a sample of the liquid portion of the bone marrow. In myelofibrosis, a complete blood count typically shows abnormally low levels of red blood cells, a sign of anemia common in people with myelofibrosis. Often, white blood cell levels are higher than normal, although in some people they may be normal or even lower than normal.

Myocardial infarction,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106,"However, the more signs and symptoms one has, the greater the chance one is having a heart attack. Some heart attacks strike suddenly, but many people have warning signs and symptoms hours, days or weeks in advance. If one suspect one is having a heart attack, don't hesitate. If one don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive one to the nearest hospital. Aspirin can interact with other medications, however, so don't take an aspirin unless the doctor or emergency medical personnel recommend it. If one see someone who's unconscious and one believe is having a heart attack, first call for emergency medical help.",,"Over time, a buildup of fatty deposits, including cholesterol, form substances called plaques, which can narrow the arteries (atherosclerosis). This condition, called coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. If the clot is large, it can block blood flow through the coronary artery, starving the heart of oxygen and nutrients (ischemia).","Over time, high blood pressure can damage arteries that lead to the heart. High blood pressure that occurs with other conditions, such as obesity, high cholesterol or diabetes, increases the risk even more. A high level of triglycerides, a type of blood fat related to the diet, also increases the risk of a heart attack. However, a high level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (good cholesterol) may lower the risk. Obesity is linked with high blood cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure and diabetes. Not producing enough of a hormone secreted by the pancreas (insulin) or not responding to insulin properly causes the body's blood sugar levels to rise, increasing the risk of a heart attack. If the siblings, parents or grandparents have had early heart attacks (by age 55 for males and by age 65 for females), one might be at increased risk. This condition causes high blood pressure during pregnancy and increases the lifetime risk of heart disease.","Ideally, the doctor should screen one during regular physical exams for risk factors that can lead to a heart attack. If one is in an emergency setting for symptoms of a heart attack, one will be asked about the symptoms and have the blood pressure, pulse and temperature checked. Tests to diagnose a heart attack include If one has had or are having a heart attack, doctors will take immediate steps to treat the condition. Because injured heart muscle doesn't conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG may show that a heart attack has occurred or is in progress. A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of the heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that's fed through an artery, usually in the leg or groin, to the arteries in the heart.",,"Some of the major risk factors for a heart attack high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes cause no symptoms early on. Excess weight strains the heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in the diet can narrow arteries to the heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, and fruits and vegetables and whole grains. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels.","Medications to treat a heart attack might include In addition to medications, one might have one of these procedures to treat the heart attack: Coronary angioplasty and stenting. In this procedure, also known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), doctors guide a long, thin tube (catheter) through an artery in the groin or wrist to a blocked artery in the heart. If one has had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to find blockages. A metal mesh stent almost always is inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. In some cases, doctors perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, however, one might have bypass surgery after the heart has had time about three to seven days to recover from the heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking blood flow to the heart. The earlier one receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance one will survive and have less heart damage. One will likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make the blood less sticky and less likely to form clots. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. These medications help relax the heart muscle, slow the heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making the heart's job easier.","Cardiology, emergency medicine","Chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, cold sweat, feeling tired; arm, neck, back, jaw, or stomach pain",,,Usually coronary artery disease,"High blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol","Electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, coronary angiography",,"Percutaneous coronary intervention, thrombolysis",STEMI 10% risk of death (developed world),15.9 million (2015),"Aspirin, nitroglycerin, heparin",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/AMI_pain_back.png

Conditions that can cause myocardial ischemia include Chest pain associated with myocardial ischemia can be triggered by: Coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis). The clot might block an artery and lead to sudden, severe myocardial ischemia, resulting in a heart attack. Rarely, a blood clot might travel to the coronary artery from elsewhere in the body.","Over time, high blood pressure can accelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in damage to the coronary arteries. A high level of bad (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) cholesterol in the blood may be due to an inherited condition or a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol. Obesity is associated with diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels. A waist measurement of more than 35 inches (89 centimeters) for women and 40 inches (102 cm) in men increases the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease.","Exercise makes the heart pump harder and faster than usual, so a stress test can detect heart problems that might not be noticeable otherwise. A stress echocardiogram is similar to a regular echocardiogram, except the test is done after one exercise in the doctor's office on a treadmill or stationary bike.

These medications widen arteries, improving blood flow to and from the heart. These medications help relax the heart muscle, slow the heartbeat and decrease blood pressure so blood can flow to the heart more easily.

Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Signs and symptoms generally appear in the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Because tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, schwannomatosis doesn't cause the hearing loss experienced by people with NF2. Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults.","Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissue. However, complications of neurofibromatosis can include hearing loss, learning impairment, heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems, loss of vision, and severe pain.","The mutated gene causes a loss of neurofibromin, which allows cells to grow uncontrolled. The NF2 gene is located on chromosome 22, and produces a protein called merlin (also called schwannomin), which suppresses tumors. The mutated gene causes a loss of merlin, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Mutations of the genes SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which suppress tumors, are associated with this type of neurofibromatosis.","A person with an autosomal dominant disorder in this case, the father has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one abnormal gene and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child with two normal genes. NF1 and NF2 are both autosomal dominant disorders, which means that any child of a parent with the disorder has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genetic mutation.","The doctor may use a special lamp to check the skin for caf au lait spots, which can help diagnose NF1. If additional tests are needed to diagnose NF1, NF2 or schwannomatosis, the doctor might recommend: For a diagnosis of NF1, one must have at least two signs of the condition. If the child has only one sign and no family history of NF1, the doctor will likely monitor the child for the development of any additional signs. A test that measures hearing (audiometry), a test that uses electrodes to record the eye movements (electronystagmography) and a test that measures the electrical messages that carry sound from the inner ear to the brain (brainstem auditory evoked response) can help assess hearing and balance problems in people with NF2.

A small tissue sample is taken from one or more lesions in the mouth and examined under a microscope to look for indications of oral lichen planus. Other more specialized microscopic tests may be needed to identify immune system proteins commonly associated with oral lichen planus. These may be done to identify conditions such as hepatitis C, which may rarely be associated with oral lichen planus, and lupus, which may look similar to oral lichen planus.","There is no cure, so the treatment focuses on helping severe lesions heal and reducing pain or other discomfort. If one has no pain or discomfort and if only white, lacy lesions are present, one may not need any treatment.","In addition to regular medical and dental treatment, self-care measures may help improve the oral lichen planus symptoms or help prevent recurring episodes of severe symptoms: Practice good oral hygiene. Because stress may complicate symptoms or trigger symptom recurrence, one may need to develop skills to avoid or manage stress. The doctor may refer one to a mental health professional who can help one identify stressors, develop stress management strategies or address other mental health concerns.

Osteoarthritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoarthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351925,"Signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis include If one has joint pain or stiffness that doesn't go away, make an appointment with the doctor. Joint stiffness might be most noticeable upon awakening or after being inactive. The joint might feel tender when one apply light pressure to or near it. One might feel a grating sensation when one use the joint, and one might hear popping or crackling. These extra bits of bone, which feel like hard lumps, can form around the affected joint.","Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint, the disorder most commonly affects joints in the hands, knees, hips and spine.",,"Carrying extra body weight contributes to osteoarthritis in several ways, and the more one weigh, the greater the risk. Increased weight adds stress to weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees. Injuries, such as those that occur when playing sports or from an accident, can increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Even injuries that occurred many years ago and seemingly healed can increase the risk of osteoarthritis. If the job or a sport one play places repetitive stress on a joint, that joint might eventually develop osteoarthritis.","To get pictures of the affected joint, the doctor might recommend: Analyzing the blood or joint fluid can help confirm the diagnosis. Cartilage doesn't show up on X-ray images, but cartilage loss is revealed by a narrowing of the space between the bones in the joint. An MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of bone and soft tissues, including cartilage. Although there's no blood test for osteoarthritis, certain tests can help rule out other causes of joint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis.",,"Exercising and losing weight if one is overweight are important ways to lessen the joint pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis. New pain that lasts for hours after one exercise probably means one has overdone it, not that one has caused damage or that one should stop exercising. Many people use these therapies to reduce stress in their lives, and research suggests that tai chi and yoga might reduce osteoarthritis pain and improve movement. Carrying extra weight increases the stress on the weight-bearing joints, such as the knees and the hips. Heat, especially moist heat, can help muscles relax and ease pain. Topical capsaicin, a chili pepper extract, applied to the skin over an arthritic joint might help some people.","Medications that can help relieve osteoarthritis symptoms, primarily pain, include Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, others), taken at the recommended doses, typically relieve osteoarthritis pain.

If one has a clotting disorder, blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), might be recommended to prevent clots in the vessels feeding the bones. Besides reducing the pain, the extra space within the bone stimulates the production of healthy bone tissue and new blood vessels. A wedge of bone is removed above or below a weight-bearing joint, to help shift the weight off the damaged bone. If the diseased bone has collapsed or other treatments aren't helping, one might need surgery to replace the damaged parts of the joint with plastic or metal parts.

Fluid accumulates inside the follicle, and a corpus luteum cyst develops. If a normal monthly follicle keeps growing, it's known as a functional cyst. The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls. Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm. If the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote. If the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body perhaps before it even reaches the uterus. Around the midpoint of the menstrual cycle, an egg bursts out of its follicle and travels down the fallopian tube. A follicular cyst begins when the follicle doesn't rupture or release its egg, but continues to grow. When a follicle releases its egg, it begins producing estrogen and progesterone for conception. Sometimes, fluid accumulates inside the follicle, causing the corpus luteum to grow into a cyst.","These include taking the fertility drug clomiphene (Clomid), which is used to cause one to ovulate.

Most women with Paget's disease of the breast have underlying ductal breast cancer, either in situ meaning in its original place or, less commonly, invasive breast cancer.",,"Risk factors that affect the likelihood of developing Paget's disease of the breast are the same factors that affect the risk of developing any other type of breast cancer. Some factors that make one more susceptible to breast cancer include Having one or more risk factors doesn't necessarily mean one will develop breast cancer. If one has had breast cancer in one breast, one has an increased risk of developing cancer in the other breast. If one has had lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical hyperplasia, the risk of developing breast cancer is higher. If one has a mother, sister or daughter with breast or ovarian cancer or both, or even a father or brother with breast cancer, one has a greater chance of developing breast cancer. Defects in one of several genes, especially BRCA1 or BRCA2, put one at greater risk of developing breast cancer as well as ovarian and other cancers. Women with dense breast tissue, as seen on a mammogram, face a higher risk of breast cancer. If one received radiation treatments to the chest as a child or young adult to treat another cancer, one is more likely to develop breast cancer later in life. Weighing more than is healthy for the age and height increases the risk of breast cancer especially after menopause and if one gained weight as an adult. Drinking large amounts of alcohol increases the risk of developing breast cancer.","A mammogram an X-ray exam of the breast tissue may indicate whether the nipple and skin changes are linked to an underlying breast cancer, as is usually the case in Paget's disease of the breast. If results from mammography in both breasts don't reveal any signs of breast cancer, the doctor may follow up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which may detect cancer that's not able to be seen on a mammogram. If one has invasive breast cancer, the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes) need to be checked to see if the cancer has spread to this area. During the biopsy, the surgeon locates the sentinel nodes the first lymph nodes to receive the drainage from breast tumors and therefore the first place cancer cells will travel. During this exam, the doctor physically checks for unusual areas in both breasts, noting the appearance of the skin on and around the nipples and feeling for any lumps or areas of thickening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Extramammary_Paget_disease_-_high_mag.jpg
"Pain , chest",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838,,"Chest pain appears in many forms, ranging from a sharp stab to a dull ache. Because chest pain can indicate a serious problem, it's important to seek immediate medical help.","Chest pain has many possible causes, all of which need medical attention. A heart attack results from blocked blood flow, often from a blood clot, to the heart muscle. Angina is the term for chest pain caused by poor blood flow to the heart. This is often caused by the buildup of thick plaques on the inner walls of the arteries that carry blood to the heart. These plaques narrow the arteries and restrict the heart's blood supply, particularly during exertion. If the inner layers of this blood vessel separate, blood is forced between the layers and can cause the aorta to rupture. In this condition, the cartilage of the rib cage, particularly the cartilage that joins the ribs to the breastbone, becomes inflamed and painful. Chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, can produce persistent muscle-related chest pain. This occurs when a blood clot becomes lodged in a lung (pulmonary) artery, blocking blood flow to lung tissue. If the membrane that covers the lungs becomes inflamed, it can cause chest pain that worsens when one inhale or cough. The chest pain associated with a collapsed lung typically begins suddenly and can last for hours, and is generally associated with shortness of breath. This condition occurs when one has high blood pressure in the arteries carrying blood to the lungs, which can produce chest pain. Caused by a reactivation of the chickenpox virus, shingles can produce pain and a band of blisters from the back around to the chest wall.",,"Some of the first tests the doctor may order include Depending upon the results from these initial tests, one may need follow-up testing, which may include Electrocardiogram (ECG). Because injured heart muscle doesn't conduct electrical impulses normally, the ECG may show that one has had or are having a heart attack. The doctor may order blood tests to check for increased levels of certain proteins or enzymes normally found in heart muscle. Damage to heart cells from a heart attack may allow these proteins or enzymes to leak, over a period of hours, into the blood. An X-ray of the chest allows doctors to check the condition of the lungs and the size and shape of the heart and major blood vessels. A CT coronary angiogram can also be done with dye to check the heart and lung arteries for blockages and other problems. These measure how the heart and blood vessels respond to exertion, which may indicate if the chest pain is heart-related. A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of the heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that's fed through an artery, either through the wrist or the groin, to arteries in the heart.",,,"Nitroglycerin usually taken as a tablet under the tongue relaxes heart arteries, so blood can flow more easily through the narrowed spaces. If doctors suspect that the chest pain is related to the heart, one will likely be given aspirin. If one has a clot in an artery feeding the heart or lungs, one will be given drugs that inhibit blood clotting to prevent the formation of more clots. If the chest pain is caused by stomach acid splashing into the esophagus, the doctor may suggest medications that reduce the amount of acid in the stomach. If the chest pain is caused by a blockage in an artery feeding the heart, the doctor will insert a catheter with a balloon on the end into a large blood vessel in the groin, and thread it up to the blockage. During this procedure, surgeons take a blood vessel from another part of the body and use it to create an alternative route for blood to go around the blocked artery. One may need emergency surgery to repair an aortic dissection a life-threatening condition in which the artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body ruptures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/GERD.png
Painful bladder syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-cystitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354357,"Interstitial cystitis signs and symptoms include Symptoms severity is different for everyone, and some people may experience symptom-free periods. Although signs and symptoms of interstitial cystitis may resemble those of a chronic urinary tract infection, there's usually no infection. However, symptoms may worsen if a person with interstitial cystitis gets a urinary tract infection.","The bladder, kidneys, ureters and urethra make up the urinary system. When one has interstitial cystitis, the walls of the bladder become irritated and inflamed (shown right), compared with those of a normal bladder (shown top). Interstitial cystitis (in-tur-STISH-ul sis-TIE-tis) is a chronic condition causing bladder pressure, bladder pain and sometimes pelvic pain. With interstitial cystitis, these signals get mixed up one feel the need to urinate more often and with smaller volumes of urine than most people.",,"Symptoms in men may mimic interstitial cystitis, but they're more often associated with an inflammation of the prostate gland (prostatitis). Having fair skin and red hair has been associated with a greater risk of interstitial cystitis. Interstitial cystitis may be associated with other chronic pain disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia.","The doctor will ask one to describe the symptoms and may ask one to keep a bladder diary, recording the volume of fluids one drink and the volume of urine one pass. The doctor inserts a thin tube with a tiny camera (cystoscope) through the urethra, showing the lining of the bladder. During cystoscopy under anesthesia, the doctor may remove a sample of tissue (biopsy) from the bladder and the urethra for examination under a microscope. The doctor places (instills) two solutions water and potassium chloride into the bladder, one at a time. If one feel noticeably more pain or urgency with the potassium solution than with the water, the doctor may diagnose interstitial cystitis.",,"Eliminating or reducing foods in the diet that irritate the bladder may help to relieve the discomfort of interstitial cystitis. Common bladder irritants known as the four Cs include carbonated beverages, caffeine in all forms (including chocolate), citrus products and food containing high concentrations of vitamin C. Consider avoiding similar foods, such as tomatoes, pickled foods, alcohol and spices. If one think certain foods may irritate the bladder, try eliminating them from the diet. During bladder training, one may learn to control urinary urges by using relaxation techniques, such as breathing slowly and deeply or distracting theself with another activity. Smoking may worsen any painful condition, and smoking contributes to bladder cancer.","In bladder instillation, the doctor places the prescription medication dimethyl sulfoxide (Rimso-50) into the bladder through a thin, flexible tube (catheter) inserted through the urethra. One might receive dimethyl sulfoxide also called DMSO treatment weekly for six to eight weeks, and then have maintenance treatments as needed such as every couple of weeks, for up to one year. A newer approach to bladder instillation uses a solution containing the medications lidocaine, sodium bicarbonate, and either pentosan or heparin. People with severe pain or those whose bladders can hold only very small volumes of urine are possible candidates for surgery, but usually only after other treatments fail and symptoms affect quality of life.",Urology,"Chronic pain of the bladder, feeling the need to urinate right away, needing to urinate often, pain with sex",Middle age,Long term,Unknown,,Based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions,,"Lifestyle changes, medications, procedures",,0.5% of people,"Ibuprofen, pentosan polysulfate, amitriptyline",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/JMedLife-03-167-g002.jpg

The medical term for painful intercourse is dyspareunia (dis-puh-ROO-nee-uh), defined as persistent or recurrent genital pain that occurs just before, during or after intercourse.","Physical causes of painful intercourse differ, depending on whether the pain occurs at entry or with deep thrusting. Pain during penetration might be associated with a range of factors, including Not enough lubrication. Certain medications are known to affect sexual desire or arousal, which can decrease lubrication and make sex painful. Causes include Emotions are deeply intertwined with sexual activity, so they might play a role in sexual pain. This includes injury or irritation from an accident, pelvic surgery, female circumcision or a cut made during childbirth to enlarge the birth canal (episiotomy). Scarring from pelvic surgery, including hysterectomy, can cause painful intercourse. Medical treatments for cancer, such as radiation and chemotherapy, can cause changes that make sex painful.",,"The doctor might ask when the pain began, where it hurts, how it feels and if it happens with every sexual partner and every sexual position. The doctor might also inquire about the sexual history, surgical history and childbirth. If the doctor suspects certain causes of painful intercourse, he or she might also recommend a pelvic ultrasound.",,"One and the partner might be able to minimize pain with a few changes to the sexual routine: Change positions. If one has sharp pain during thrusting, try different positions, such as being on top. In this position, one might be able to regulate penetration to a depth that feels good to one.","The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug ospemifene (Osphena) to treat moderate to severe dyspareunia in women who have problems with vaginal lubrication. Drawbacks are that the drug might cause hot flashes, and it carries a risk of stroke, blood clots and cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrium).

Painful periods,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menstrual-cramps/symptoms-causes/syc-20374938,,Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) are throbbing or cramping pains in the lower abdomen. Menstrual cramps that aren't caused by another condition tend to lessen with age and often improve after giving birth.,"During the menstrual period, the uterus contracts to help expel its lining. The tissue that lines the uterus becomes implanted outside the uterus, most commonly on the fallopian tubes, ovaries or the tissue lining the pelvis. In some women, the opening of the cervix is small enough to impede menstrual flow, causing a painful increase of pressure within the uterus.",,"During the pelvic exam, the doctor will check for abnormalities in the reproductive organs and look for signs of infection. If the doctor suspects that a disorder is causing the menstrual cramps, he or she may recommend other tests, such as: Other imaging tests. CT combines X-ray images taken from many angles to produce cross-sectional images of bones, organs and other soft tissues inside the body. Although not usually necessary to diagnosis menstrual cramps, laparoscopy can help detect an underlying condition, such as endometriosis, adhesions, fibroids, ovarian cysts and ectopic pregnancy. During this outpatient surgery, the doctor views the abdominal cavity and reproductive organs by making tiny incisions in the abdomen and inserting a fiber-optic tube with a small camera lens.","To ease the menstrual cramps, the doctor might recommend: Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), at regular doses starting the day before one expect the period to begin can help control the pain of cramps. Besides getting enough sleep and rest, things one might want to try include Most alternative therapies for treating menstrual cramps haven't been studied enough for experts to recommend them. However, some alternative treatments might help, including Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). If one has bothersome menstrual cramps, make an appointment with either the primary physician or a doctor who specializes in the female reproductive system (gynecologist). These hormones can also be delivered in several other forms: an injection, a skin patch, an implant placed under the skin of the arm, a flexible ring that one insert into the vagina, or an intrauterine device (IUD). If the menstrual cramps are caused by a disorder such as endometriosis or fibroids, surgery to correct the problem might help the symptoms. Physical activity, including sex, helps ease menstrual cramps for some women. Soaking in a hot bath or using a heating pad, hot water bottle or heat patch on the lower abdomen might ease menstrual cramps. A number of studies have indicated that vitamin E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B-1 (thiamin), vitamin B-6 and magnesium supplements might reduce menstrual cramps. Some herbal products, such as pycnogenol, fennel or combination products, might provide some relief from menstrual cramps. Although research on acupressure and menstrual cramps is limited, it appears that acupressure may be more effective than a placebo in easing menstrual cramps.","Besides getting enough sleep and rest, things one might want to try include Exercise regularly.

In general, cerebral palsy causes impaired movement associated with abnormal reflexes, floppiness or rigidity of the limbs and trunk, abnormal posture, involuntary movements, unsteady walking, or some combination of these. People with cerebral palsy can have problems swallowing and commonly have eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object.",,"A number of factors are associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy. Certain infections or toxic exposures during pregnancy can significantly increase cerebral palsy risk to the baby. Infections of particular concern include Illnesses in a newborn baby that can greatly increase the risk of cerebral palsy include While the potential contribution from each is limited, additional pregnancy or birth factors associated with increased cerebral palsy risk include Cytomegalovirus. Infants for whom maternal Zika infection causes their head size to be smaller than normal (microcephaly) can develop cerebral palsy. Other conditions that can increase the risk of cerebral palsy include thyroid problems, intellectual disabilities or seizures, and exposure to toxins, such as methyl mercury. Babies who weigh less than 5.5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) are at higher risk of developing cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy risk increases with the number of babies sharing the uterus. If one or more of the babies die, the survivors risk of cerebral palsy increases. Babies born fewer than 28 weeks into the pregnancy are at higher risk of cerebral palsy. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the cerebral palsy risk.","If the family doctor or pediatrician suspects the child has cerebral palsy, he or she will evaluate the child's signs and symptoms, monitor growth and development, review the child's medical history, and conduct a physical exam. The doctor might refer one to a specialist trained in treating children with brain and nervous system conditions (pediatric neurologist, pediatric physical medicine and rehabilitation specialist, or child developmental specialist). An MRI scan uses radio waves and a magnetic field to produce detailed 3D or cross-sectional images of the child's brain. If the child is diagnosed with cerebral palsy, one will likely be referred to specialists to test the child for other conditions often associated with the disorder. An ultrasound doesn't produce a detailed image, but it may be used because it's quick and inexpensive, and it can provide a valuable preliminary assessment of the brain.",,,"Medications that can lessen muscle tightness might be used to improve functional abilities, treat pain and manage complications related to spasticity or other cerebral palsy symptoms. To treat tightening of a specific muscle, the doctor might recommend injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox, Dysport) or another agent. Drugs such as diazepam (Valium), dantrolene (Dantrium), baclofen (Gablofen, Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) are often used to relax muscles. Muscle training and exercises can help the child's strength, flexibility, balance, motor development and mobility. One will also learn how to safely care for the child's everyday needs at home, such as bathing and feeding the child. Braces or splints might be recommended for the child to help with function, such as improved walking, and stretching stiff muscles. Children with severe contractures or deformities might need surgery on bones or joints to place their arms, hips or legs in their correct positions. Occupational therapists work to help the child gain independence in daily activities and routines in the home, the school and the community. This type of therapy can help improve the child's motor skills, speech and emotional well-being.

Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma).

Parkinson 's disease,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055,"Symptoms often begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that side, even after symptoms begin to affect both sides. One may a rub the thumb and forefinger back-and-forth, known as a pill-rolling tremor. Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow the movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. The posture may become stooped, or one may have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease. One may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging the arms when one walk. One may speak softly, quickly, slur or hesitate before talking. It may become hard to write, and the writing may appear small.","Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve the symptoms.","In Parkinson's disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in the brain gradually break down or die. When dopamine levels decrease, it causes abnormal brain activity, leading to symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including The genes. Researchers have also noted that many changes occur in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease, although it's not clear why these changes occur. These are called Lewy bodies, and researchers believe these Lewy bodies hold an important clue to the cause of Parkinson's disease. Although many substances are found within Lewy bodies, scientists believe an important one is the natural and widespread protein called alpha-synuclein (a-synuclein).","Risk factors for Parkinson's disease include Age. Having a close relative with Parkinson's disease increases the chances that one will develop the disease. However, the risks are still small unless one has many relatives in the family with Parkinson's disease. Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase the risk of Parkinson's disease.","The doctor trained in nervous system conditions (neurologist) will diagnose Parkinson's disease based on the medical history, a review of the signs and symptoms, and a neurological and physical examination. In addition to the examination, the doctor may give one carbidopa-levodopa (Rytary, Sinemet, others), a Parkinson's disease medication. Doctors may recommend regular follow-up appointments with neurologists trained in movement disorders to evaluate the condition and symptoms over time and diagnose Parkinson's disease.",,"If one has received a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, one will need to work closely with the doctor to find a treatment plan that offers one the greatest relief from symptoms with the fewest side effects. Certain lifestyle changes also may help make living with Parkinson's disease easier. While no food or combination of foods has been proved to help in Parkinson's disease, some foods may help ease some of the symptoms. For example, eating foods high in fiber and drinking an adequate amount of fluids can help prevent constipation that is common in Parkinson's disease. A balanced diet also provides nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, that might be beneficial for people with Parkinson's disease. One may also try exercises such as walking, swimming, gardening, dancing, water aerobics or stretching. Parkinson's disease can disturb the sense of balance, making it difficult to walk with a normal gait. These suggestions may also help: In the later stages of the disease, one may fall more easily. The following suggestions may help: Daily living activities such as dressing, eating, bathing and writing can be difficult for people with Parkinson's disease.","Levodopa, the most effective Parkinson's disease medication, is a natural chemical that passes into the brain and is converted to dopamine. Levodopa is combined with carbidopa (Lodosyn), which protects levodopa from early conversion to dopamine outside the brain. After years, as the disease progresses, the benefit from levodopa may become less stable, with a tendency to wax and wane (wearing off). Also, one may experience involuntary movements (dyskinesia) after taking higher doses of levodopa. Dopamine agonists include pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip) and rotigotine (Neupro, given as a patch). Apomorphine (Apokyn), is a short-acting injectable dopamine agonist used for quick relief. These medications include selegiline (Eldepryl, Zelapar), rasagiline (Azilect) and safinamide (Xadago). Side effects, including an increased risk of involuntary movements (dyskinesia), mainly result from an enhanced levodopa effect. Several anticholinergic medications are available, including benztropine (Cogentin) or trihexyphenidyl. It may also be given with carbidopa-levodopa therapy during the later stages of Parkinson's disease to control involuntary movements (dyskinesia) induced by carbidopa-levodopa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Ambox_current_red_Americas.svg

However, a large patent ductus arteriosus left untreated can allow poorly oxygenated blood to flow in the wrong direction, weakening the heart muscle and causing heart failure and other complications.","The ductus arteriosus diverts blood from a baby's lungs while they develop, and the baby receives oxygen from the mother's circulation. Untreated, the blood pressure in the baby's lungs might increase (pulmonary hypertension) and the baby's heart might enlarge and weaken.","Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs more commonly in babies who are born too early than in babies who are born full term.

Babies born above 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) have a greater risk of a PDA than babies born at lower altitudes.","If the doctor suspects a heart defect, he or she might request one or more of the following tests: Echocardiogram. Sound waves produce images of the heart that can help the doctor identify a PDA, see if the heart chambers are enlarged, and judge how well the heart is pumping. This test isn't usually necessary for diagnosing a PDA alone, but it might be done to examine other congenital heart defects found during an echocardiogram or if a catheter procedure is being considered to treat a PDA.","However, if the baby doesn't have PDA-related health problems, the doctor might recommend waiting until the baby is older to do a catheter procedure to correct the PDA. Catheter procedures can also be used to treat full-term babies, children and adults. For full-term babies, children and adults who have small PDAs that aren't causing other health problems, monitoring might be all that's needed. In a premature baby, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Infant's Motrin, others) or indomethacin (Indocin) might be used to help close a PDA.

Peripheral neuropathy can result from traumatic injuries, infections, metabolic problems, inherited causes and exposure to toxins.","Not a single disease, peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage caused by a number of conditions. Health conditions that can cause peripheral neuropathy include Other causes of neuropathies include In a number of cases, no cause can be identified (idiopathic). These include Sjogren's syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and vasculitis. These include certain viral or bacterial infections, including Lyme disease, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B and C, leprosy, diphtheria, and HIV. Growths, cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous (benign), can develop on the nerves or press nerves. Also, polyneuropathy can arise as a result of some cancers related to the body's immune response. These include an abnormal protein in the blood (monoclonal gammopathies), a form of bone cancer (myeloma), lymphoma and the rare disease amyloidosis. These include kidney disease, liver disease, connective tissue disorders and an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). Certain medications, especially those used to treat cancer (chemotherapy), can cause peripheral neuropathy.

B vitamins including B-1, B-6 and B-12 vitamin E and niacin are crucial to nerve health.",,"Besides a physical exam, which may include blood tests, diagnosis usually requires: The doctor may order tests, including Nerve function tests. At the same time as an electromyogram, the doctor or an EMG technician typically performs a nerve conduction study. The doctor will review the medical history, including the symptoms, the lifestyle, exposure to toxins, drinking habits and a family history of nervous system (neurological) diseases. The doctor might check the tendon reflexes, the muscle strength and tone, the ability to feel certain sensations, and the posture and coordination. These might include an autonomic reflex screen that records how the autonomic nerve fibers work, a sweat test that measures the body's ability to sweat, and sensory tests that record how one feel touch, vibration, cooling and heat. This involves removing a small portion of a nerve, usually a sensory nerve, to look for abnormalities.",,"To help one manage peripheral neuropathy: Take care of the feet, especially if one has diabetes. Regular exercise, such as walking three times a week, can reduce neuropathy pain, improve muscle strength and help control blood sugar levels. If one has diabetes, this will help keep the blood glucose under control and might help improve the neuropathy.","Besides medications used to treat conditions associated with peripheral neuropathy, medications used to relieve peripheral neuropathy signs and symptoms include Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can relieve mild symptoms. Medications containing opioids, such as tramadol (Conzip, Ultram) or oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others), can lead to dependence and addiction, so these drugs generally are prescribed only when other treatments fail. Capsaicin cream, which contains a substance found in hot peppers, can cause modest improvements in peripheral neuropathy symptoms. Certain tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, doxepin (Silenor, Zonalon) and nortriptyline (Pamelor), have been found to help relieve pain by interfering with chemical processes in the brain and spinal cord that cause one to feel pain. The serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine (Cymbalta) and the extended-release antidepressant venlafaxine (Effexor XR) also might ease the pain of peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes. Side effects of antidepressants may include dry mouth, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, decreased appetite and constipation.

In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. This causes symptoms such as: This hormone helps the adrenal glands work properly, and helps the body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include This hormone, which is also called vasopressin, helps the body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk. These could be signs and symptoms of sudden destruction of the pituitary gland tissue (pituitary apoplexy), often caused by bleeding into the pituitary gland.","The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are located within the brain and control hormone production. It is part of the body's endocrine system, which consists of all the glands that produce and regulate hormones. Despite its small size, the pituitary gland creates and releases a number of hormones that act on nearly every part of the body.","In addition to tumors, certain diseases or events that cause damage to the pituitary gland may also trigger hypopituitarism. Tumors or diseases of the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain situated just above the pituitary, also can cause hypopituitarism.",,"If the doctor suspects a problem with the pituitary hormones, he or she will likely order several tests to check hormone levels in the body and search for a cause. For example, blood tests can identify low levels of thyroid, adrenal or sex hormones. The tests can determine if these low levels are associated with pituitary hormone production. These tests check the body's hormone levels after one has taken certain medications to stimulate hormone production.",,,"Hormone replacement medications may include A doctor who specializes in endocrine disorders (endocrinologist) may monitor the symptoms and the levels of these hormones in the blood to ensure one is getting the appropriate amounts. These drugs, such as hydrocortisone (Cortef) or prednisone (Rayos), replace the adrenal hormones that aren't being produced because of an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency.

Signs and symptoms of pressure from a pituitary tumor may include Functioning pituitary tumors cause an overproduction of hormones. Signs and symptoms include ACTH tumors produce the hormone adrenocorticotropin, which stimulates the adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. Overproduction of prolactin from a pituitary tumor (prolactinoma) can cause a decrease in normal levels of sex hormones estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Signs and symptoms can include When a pituitary tumor overproduces thyroid-stimulating hormone, the thyroid gland makes too much of the hormone thyroxine.",,,,"To diagnose a pituitary tumor, the doctor will likely take a detailed history and perform a physical exam. A CT scan or MRI scan of the brain can help the doctor judge the location and size of a pituitary tumor.","Treatment involves a team of medical experts, possibly including a brain surgeon (neurosurgeon), endocrine system specialist (endocrinologist) and a radiation oncologist. Doctors generally use surgery, radiation therapy and medications, either alone or in combination, to treat a pituitary tumor and return hormone production to normal levels.",,"Treatment with medications may help to block excess hormone secretion and sometimes shrink certain types of pituitary tumors: ACTH-producing tumors (Cushing syndrome). Mifepristone (Korlym, Mifeprex) is approved for people with Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance. Side effects may include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, headaches, muscle aches, high blood pressure, low potassium and swelling. The newest medication for Cushing syndrome is pasireotide (Signifor), and it works by decreasing ACTH production from a pituitary tumor. Side effects are fairly common, and may include diarrhea, nausea, high blood sugar, headache, abdominal pain and fatigue. One type of drugs known as somatostatin analogs, which includes drugs such as octreotide (Sandostatin) and lanreotide (Somatuline Depot), causes a decrease in growth hormone production and may shrink the tumor. These drugs can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, dizziness, headache and pain at the site of injection. The second type of drugs, pegvisomant (Somavert), blocks the effect of excess growth hormone on the body. If a pituitary tumor or surgery to remove it decreases hormone production, one will likely need to take replacement hormones to maintain normal hormone levels.","Oncology, endocrinology",,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Acromegaly_facial_features.JPEG

The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.","Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be serious because the bacteria causing it may be more resistant to antibiotics and because the people who get it are already sick. People who are on breathing machines (ventilators), often used in intensive care units, are at higher risk of this type of pneumonia. Health care-acquired pneumonia is a bacterial infection that occurs in people who live in long-term care facilities or who receive care in outpatient clinics, including kidney dialysis centers. Like hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-acquired pneumonia can be caused by bacteria that are more resistant to antibiotics. This type of pneumonia is most common in people with chronic health problems or weakened immune systems, and in people who have inhaled large doses of the organisms.

Post-polio syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-polio-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355669,,,,"Factors that can increase the risk of developing post-polio syndrome include Severity of initial polio infection. If one developed polio as an adolescent or adult rather than as a child, the chances of developing post-polio syndrome increase. The greater the recovery after acute polio, the more likely it seems that post-polio syndrome will develop, perhaps because greater recovery places additional stress on motor neurons. If one often exercise to the point of exhaustion or fatigue, one might overwork already stressed-out motor neurons and increase the risk of post-polio syndrome.","For a diagnosis of post-polio syndrome, doctors look for three indicators: In addition, because the signs and symptoms of post-polio syndrome are similar to those of other disorders, the doctor will attempt to exclude other possible causes, such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and scoliosis. Because there are no tests that confirm a post-polio syndrome diagnosis, the doctor may use certain tests to rule out other conditions, including Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies. These tests help identify and exclude conditions such as an abnormal condition of the nerves (neuropathy) and a muscle tissue disorder (myopathy). A noninvasive test shows promise for evaluating the severity of post-polio syndrome and monitoring its progression is muscle ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create images of muscles. These tests can help exclude spinal disorders, such as the degenerative spine condition spondylosis or narrowing of the spinal column that puts pressure on the nerves (spinal stenosis).","Exercising to maintain fitness is important, but avoid overusing the muscles and joints and exercising to the point of pain or fatigue. Other possible treatment options may include the anticonvulsant drug gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise) which is often used to treat nerve pain. However, one will likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in nervous system disorders (neurologist). Assistive devices such as a cane, walker, wheelchair or motor scooter can help one conserve energy. One might need to change the sleeping patterns, such as avoiding sleeping on the back, or use a device that helps open the airway when one sleep. Pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) might ease muscle and joint pain.","Recovering from the initial illness required drive and determination, but now the late effects of polio require one to rest and conserve the energy. Get rid of throw rugs and loose clutter on the floor, wear good shoes, and avoid slippery or icy surfaces. Eat a balanced diet, stop smoking and decrease caffeine intake to keep fit, breathe easier and sleep better.",,Infectious disease,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Clarke_sm.jpg
Postural hypotension,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/orthostatic-hypotension/symptoms-causes/syc-20352548,,,"Normally, special cells (baroreceptors) near the heart and neck arteries sense this lower blood pressure. The baroreceptors send signals to centers in the brain, which signals the heart to beat faster and pump more blood, which stabilizes blood pressure. Fever, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, severe diarrhea and strenuous exercise with a lot of sweating can all lead to dehydration, which decreases blood volume. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure. Thyroid conditions, adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can cause orthostatic hypotension.","These include medications used to treat high blood pressure or heart disease, such as diuretics, alpha blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nitrates. Other medications that may increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension include medications used to treat Parkinson's disease, certain antidepressants, certain antipsychotics, muscle relaxants, medications to treat erectile dysfunction and narcotics. Some heart conditions, such as heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure; certain nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease; and diseases that cause nerve damage (neuropathy), such as diabetes, increase the risk of low blood pressure. Being in a hot environment can cause heavy sweating and possibly dehydration, which can lower the blood pressure and trigger orthostatic hypotension.","During this test, the heart rate and blood pressure are monitored to evaluate the body's cardiovascular response to the change in position. The doctor will diagnose orthostatic hypotension if one has a drop of 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) in the systolic blood pressure or a drop of 10 mm Hg in the diastolic blood pressure within two to five minutes of standing, or if standing causes signs and symptoms. These can provide information about the overall health, including low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) or low red blood cell levels (anemia), both of which can cause low blood pressure. This noninvasive test checks the functioning of the autonomic nervous system by analyzing the heart rate and blood pressure after several cycles of a type of deep breathing: One breathe in deeply and push the air out through the lips, as if one were trying to blow up a stiff balloon.

Prader-Willi syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prader-willi-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355997,"Signs and symptoms that may be present from birth include Other features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. In females, the clitoris and labia may be small. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement for example, sitting up or walking later than other children do. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop.","Prader-Willi (PRAH-dur VIL-e) syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that results in a number of physical, mental and behavioral problems.

Although specific treatments vary depending on symptoms, most children with Prader-Willi syndrome will need the following: Good nutrition for infants. HGH treatment in children with Prader-Willi syndrome helps increase growth, improves muscle tone and decreases body fat. The endocrinologist may suggest that the child take hormone replacement therapy (testosterone for males or estrogen and progesterone for females) to replenish low levels of sex hormones. A dietitian can help one develop a healthy, reduced-calorie diet to help manage the child's weight while ensuring proper nutrition. The child will likely benefit from a range of therapies, including physical therapy to improve movement skills and strength, speech therapy to improve verbal skills, and occupational therapy to learn everyday skills. Developmental therapy to learn age-appropriate behaviors, social skills and interpersonal skills also may help. A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or a psychiatrist, may help address psychological problems for example, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, skin picking or a mood disorder.",Tips to help one take care of the loved one with Prader-Willi syndrome include the following: Learn about Prader-Willi syndrome.

Prediabetes,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355278,,Prediabetes means one has a higher than normal blood sugar level. The same lifestyle changes that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in adults might also help bring children's blood sugar levels back to normal.,"Moving sugar from the bloodstream to the body's cells requires a hormone called insulin. As insulin circulates, it allows sugar to enter the cells and lowers the amount of sugar in the blood. When the blood sugar level starts to drop, the pancreas slows down the secretion of insulin into the blood. The pancreas may not make enough insulin or cells become resistant to insulin and don't allow as much sugar in.","These factors include Other conditions associated with prediabetes include When these conditions occur with obesity, they are associated with insulin resistance. Eating red meat and processed meat, and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, is associated with a higher risk of prediabetes. A diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains and olive oil is associated with a lower risk of prediabetes. The less active one is, the greater the risk of prediabetes. Although diabetes can develop at any age, the risk of prediabetes increases after age 45. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races including African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are more likely to develop prediabetes. If one had diabetes while pregnant (gestational diabetes), one and the child are at higher risk of developing prediabetes. Women with this common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity have a higher risk of prediabetes.","In general: If one has prediabetes, the doctor will typically check the blood sugar levels at least once a year. These other risk factors include The ranges of blood sugar level considered normal, prediabetic and diabetic are the same for children and adults. Children who have prediabetes should be tested annually for type 2 diabetes or more often if the child experiences a change in weight or develops signs or symptoms of diabetes, such as increased thirst, increased urination, fatigue or blurred vision. An A1C level below 5.7% is considered normal An A1C level between 5.7% and 6.4% is considered prediabetes An A1C level of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests indicates type 2 diabetes A fasting blood sugar level below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) 5.6 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) is considered normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 7.0 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher indicates type 2 diabetes. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is considered normal. A blood sugar level from 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher indicates type 2 diabetes.","Healthy lifestyle choices can help one bring the blood sugar level back to normal, or at least keep it from rising toward the levels seen in type 2 diabetes. To prevent prediabetes from progressing to type 2 diabetes, try to: Eat healthy foods. If one is overweight, losing just 5% to 7% of the body weight about 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) if one weigh 200 pounds (91 kilograms) can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Try to minimize the baby's exposure to crowded places, and make sure everyone who comes into contact with the baby washes his or her hands first. Because preemies are especially at risk of a serious infection of the lungs and respiratory tract (respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV), the baby's doctor might recommend a preventive medication called palivizumab (Synagis), which helps protect the baby from this serious infection.

Presbycusis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20373072,,"Hearing loss that occurs gradually as one age (presbycusis) is common. These bones are separated from the outer ear by the eardrum (tympanic membrane), which when struck by a sound wave, vibrates. The snail-shaped chamber, called the cochlea (KOK-lee-uh), plays a role in hearing. The other fluid-filled chambers of the inner ear include three tubes called the semicircular canals (vestibular labyrinth).","When these hairs or nerve cells are damaged or missing, electrical signals aren't transmitted as efficiently, and hearing loss occurs. Vivien Williams: Dr. Matthew Carlson says temporary hearing loss can happen when the ears are plugged with wax or fluid behind the ear drum, for example. Dr. Carlson says just about all types of sensorineural hearing loss have to do with the loss of the function of hair cells in the inner ear. For people with profound hearing loss, cochlear implants work by bypassing the hair cells and sending signals directly to the hearing nerve and brain. In the outer or middle ear, any of these can cause hearing loss. Loud blasts of noise, sudden changes in pressure, poking the eardrum with an object and infection can cause the eardrum to rupture and affect the hearing.","Factors that may damage or lead to loss of the hairs and nerve cells in the inner ear include The chart below lists common sounds and their decibel levels. The louder the noise, the less time it takes to cause permanent hearing damage. Below are the maximum noise levels on the job to which one may be exposed without hearing protection, and for how long. Damage can occur with long-term exposure to loud noises, or from a short blast of noise, such as from a gunshot. Jobs where loud noise is a regular part of the working environment, such as farming, construction or factory work, can lead to damage inside the ear. Exposure to explosive noises, such as from firearms and jet engines, can cause immediate, permanent hearing loss. Other recreational activities with dangerously high noise levels include snowmobiling, motorcycling, carpentry or listening to loud music. Drugs such as the antibiotic gentamicin, sildenafil (Viagra) and certain chemotherapy drugs, can damage the inner ear. Temporary effects on the hearing ringing in the ear (tinnitus) or hearing loss can occur if one take very high doses of aspirin, other pain relievers, antimalarial drugs or loop diuretics.","Tests to diagnose hearing loss may include Physical exam. The doctor will look in the ear for possible causes of the hearing loss, such as earwax or inflammation from an infection.

When the instructions are changed in someone with juvenile PLS, the protein alsin becomes unstable and doesn't work properly, which in turn impairs normal muscle function.",,"In fact, because the disease can mimic signs and symptoms of other neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and ALS, the doctor is likely to order several tests to rule out other diseases. After taking a careful record of the medical history and family history and performing a neurological examination, the doctor might order the following tests: MRI. An MRI can show other causes of the symptoms, such as structural abnormalities, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord tumors. The doctor uses a thin, hollow needle to remove from the spinal canal small samples of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid) for laboratory analysis.","The doctor might prescribe medication such as baclofen, tizanidine (Zanaflex) or clonazepam (Klonopin) to relieve muscle spasms (spasticity). If the spasticity isn't controlled with oral medication, the doctor might recommend surgically implanting a medication pump to deliver baclofen directly to the spinal fluid (intrathecal baclofen). To cope with the disease and its effects, consider these tips: Seek emotional support. Because PLS is an uncommon diagnosis, it might be a challenge to find a local support group for people with the condition. If one reach a point where the disease is restricting the activities significantly, ask the doctor about devices designed to help one stay independent. Stretching and strengthening exercises can help maintain muscle strength, flexibility and range of motion, and prevent joint immobility.

Restoring estrogen levels in women with primary ovarian insufficiency helps prevent some complications that occur as a result of low estrogen, such as osteoporosis.","Primary ovarian insufficiency may be caused by: Ovulation is the release of an egg from one of the ovaries. The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls. Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm. If the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote. If the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body perhaps before it even reaches the uterus. Other toxins such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, pesticides and viruses might hasten ovarian failure. In this rare form, the immune system produces antibodies against the ovarian tissue, harming the egg-containing follicles and damaging the egg.",Factors that increase the risk of developing primary ovarian insufficiency include Age. Having a family history of primary ovarian insufficiency increases the risk of developing this disorder.,"Most women have few signs of primary ovarian insufficiency, but the doctor may suspect the condition if one has irregular periods or are having trouble conceiving. The doctor might ask questions about the menstrual cycle, exposure to toxins, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and previous ovarian surgery.

Psoriasis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/psoriasis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355840,"It usually causes dry, red skin lesions (plaques) covered with silvery scales. Guttate psoriasis, more common in children and adults younger than 30, appears as small, water-drop-shaped lesions on the trunk, arms, legs and scalp. Psoriasis causes red patches of skin covered with silvery scales and a thick crust on the scalp most often extending just past the hairline that may bleed when removed. Inverse psoriasis causes smooth patches of red, inflamed skin. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Pustular psoriasis generally develops quickly, with pus-filled blisters appearing just hours after the skin becomes red and tender. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a red, peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. The most commonly affected areas are the lower back, elbows, knees, legs, soles of the feet, scalp, face and palms. Most types of psoriasis go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a time or even going into remission. There are several types of psoriasis, including If one suspect that one may have psoriasis, see the doctor. Also, talk to the doctor if the psoriasis: Viven Williams: The fingernails are clues to the overall health.

Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, itchy scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk and scalp.","Psoriasis is thought to be an immune system problem that causes the skin to regenerate at faster than normal rates. In the most common type of psoriasis, known as plaque psoriasis, this rapid turnover of cells results in scales and red patches. Many people who are predisposed to psoriasis may be free of symptoms for years until the disease is triggered by some environmental factor.","Having one parent with psoriasis increases the risk of getting the disease, and having two parents with psoriasis increases the risk even more.

Pulmonary edema,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-edema/symptoms-causes/syc-20377009,,,"A number of things can cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs, but most have to do with the heart (cardiogenic pulmonary edema). The lower chambers, the right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The lower chambers (the more muscular right and left ventricles) pump blood out of the heart. Over time, the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle can become narrow from fatty deposits (plaques). Or, they don't close completely, allowing blood to flow backward through the valve (insufficiency or regurgitation). The increased pressure extends into the left atrium and then to the pulmonary veins, causing fluid to accumulate in the lungs. On the other hand, if the mitral valve leaks, some blood is backwashed toward the lung each time the heart pumps. In normal lungs, air sacs (alveoli) take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide. In high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), it's theorized that vessels in the lungs constrict, causing increased pressure. Although the exact cause isn't completely understood, HAPE seems to develop as a result of increased pressure from constriction of the pulmonary capillaries. Pulmonary embolism, a condition that occurs when blood clots travel from blood vessels in the legs to the lungs, can lead to pulmonary edema.",,"Other blood tests may be done including tests of the kidney function, thyroid function and blood count as well as tests to exclude a heart attack as the cause of the pulmonary edema. The test can help diagnose a number of heart problems, including heart valve problems, abnormal motions of the ventricular walls, fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) and congenital heart defects. If tests such as an ECG or echocardiography don't uncover the cause of the pulmonary edema, or one also have chest pain, the doctor may suggest cardiac catheterization and coronary angiogram. During cardiac catheterization, a doctor inserts a long, thin catheter in an artery or vein in the groin, neck or arm and threads it through the blood vessels to the heart using X-ray imaging. Cardiac catheterization can also be used to measure the pressure in the heart chambers, assess the heart valves and look for causes of pulmonary edema.","Depending on the condition and the reason for the pulmonary edema, one may also receive one or more of the following medications: Blood pressure medications. If one has high blood pressure when one develop pulmonary edema, one will be given medications to control it. The doctor may also prescribe blood pressure medications that ease the pressure going into (preload reducers) or out of (afterload reducers) the heart. Medications such as nitroprusside (Nitropress) are afterload reducers that dilate the blood vessels and take a pressure load off the heart's left ventricle. Doctors commonly prescribe diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix), to decrease the pressure caused by excess fluid in the heart and lungs.","Depending on the condition, the doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, including Controlling the high blood pressure.

The pain is often sharp and felt when one breathe in deeply, often stopping one from being able to take a deep breath.","Pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot gets lodged in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow to part of the lung. In most cases, pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from deep veins in the legs or, rarely, from veins in other parts of the body (deep vein thrombosis).","Pulmonary embolism occurs when a clump of material, most often a blood clot, gets wedged into an artery in the lungs. These blood clots most commonly come from the deep veins of the legs, a condition known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT).","Although anyone can develop blood clots and subsequent pulmonary embolism, certain factors can increase the risk. In addition, some medical conditions and treatments put one at risk, such as: Blood clots are more likely to form during periods of inactivity, such as: Heart disease. Certain cancers especially brain, ovary, pancreas, colon, stomach, lung and kidney cancers, and cancers that have spread can increase the risk of blood clots, and chemotherapy further increases the risk. Being confined to bed for an extended period after surgery, a heart attack, leg fracture, trauma or any serious illness makes one more vulnerable to blood clots. When the lower extremities are horizontal for long periods, the flow of venous blood slows and blood can pool in the legs, sometimes resulting in blood clots. Sitting in a cramped position during lengthy plane or car trips slows blood flow in the legs, which contributes to the formation of clots. For reasons that aren't well understood, tobacco use predisposes some people to blood clot formation, especially when combined with other risk factors. The estrogen in birth control pills and in hormone replacement therapy can increase clotting factors in the blood, especially if one smoke or are overweight.","High levels may suggest an increased likelihood of blood clots, although many other factors can also cause high D dimer levels. Although X-rays can't diagnose pulmonary embolism and may even appear normal when pulmonary embolism exists, they can rule out conditions that mimic the disease. A noninvasive test known as duplex ultrasonography (sometimes called duplex scan or compression ultrasonography) uses sound waves to scan the veins in the thigh, knee and calf, and sometimes in the arms, to check for deep vein blood clots. It's the most accurate way to diagnose pulmonary embolism, but because it requires a high degree of skill to administer and has potentially serious risks, it's usually performed when other tests fail to provide a definitive diagnosis. In a pulmonary angiogram, a flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a large vein usually in the groin and threaded through the heart and into the pulmonary arteries.",,,"Because one may be at risk of another deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, it's important to continue treatment, such as remaining on blood thinners, and be monitored as often as suggested by the doctor. While clots usually dissolve on their own, sometimes thrombolytics given through the vein can dissolve clots quickly. If one has a very large, life-threatening clot in the lung, the doctor may suggest removing it via a thin, flexible tube (catheter) threaded through the blood vessels.","Hematology, cardiology, pulmonology","Shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing up blood",Advanced age,,,"Cancer, prolonged bed rest, smoking, stroke, certain genetic conditions, estrogen-based medication, pregnancy, obesity, after surgery","Based on symptoms, D-dimer, CT pulmonary angiography, lung ventilation/perfusion scan",,"Anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, DOACs)",,"~450,000 per year (USA), 430,000 (Europe)",,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/CT_of_lung_infarction_with_reverse_halo_sign%2C_annotated.png

Researchers have several theories about what might trigger idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including viruses and exposure to tobacco smoke. Also, some forms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and heredity may play a role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Ongoing research is evaluating if GERD may be a risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or if GERD may lead to a more rapid progression of the condition. However, more research is needed to determine the association between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and GERD. Drugs designed to kill cancer cells, such as methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, others) and cyclophosphamide, can also damage lung tissue. Some drugs used to treat irregular heartbeats, such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone), may harm lung tissue. Antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Macrodantin, others) or ethambutol can cause lung damage.","Although pulmonary fibrosis has been diagnosed in children and infants, the disorder is much more likely to affect middle-aged and older adults. One has an increased risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis if one work in mining, farming or construction or if one is exposed to pollutants known to damage the lungs. Having radiation treatments to the chest or using certain chemotherapy drugs can increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Some types of pulmonary fibrosis run in families, and genetic factors may be a component.","To diagnose the condition, the doctor may review the medical and family history, discuss the signs and symptoms, review any exposure one has had to dusts, gases and chemicals, and conduct a physical exam. If other tests haven't diagnosed the condition, doctors may need to remove a small amount of lung tissue (biopsy). In this procedure, the doctor removes very small tissue samples generally no larger than the head of a pin using a small, flexible tube (bronchoscope) that's passed through the mouth or nose into the lungs. During bronchoscopy, the doctor may conduct an additional procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage. Although bronchoalveolar lavage samples a larger area of the lung than other procedures do, it may not provide enough information to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis.

If an echocardiogram reveals pulmonary hypertension, one will likely have a right heart catheterization to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor might also order one or more of the following tests to check the condition of the lungs and pulmonary arteries and further determine the cause of pulmonary hypertension: Computerized tomography (CT). A CT scan can show the heart's size, spot blood clots in the lungs arteries, and look closely for lung diseases that might lead to pulmonary hypertension, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis. If a family member has had pulmonary hypertension, the doctor might screen one for genes that are linked with pulmonary hypertension. Once one has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, the doctor might classify the severity of the disease into one of several classes, including Blood tests. Blood tests can help the doctor determine the cause of pulmonary hypertension or look for signs of complications. It can show enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart or the pulmonary arteries, which can occur in pulmonary hypertension. The doctor may also use a chest X-ray to check for other lung conditions that can cause pulmonary hypertension. It can help diagnose a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea, which can cause pulmonary hypertension. Rarely, a doctor might recommend an open-lung biopsy to check for a possible cause of pulmonary hypertension.

If one live at an altitude of 8,000 feet (2,438 meters) or higher, the doctor might recommend that one move to a lower altitude. Ask the doctor about any other medications before taking them, as some can interfere with pulmonary hypertension treatments or make the symptoms worse. Let the doctor know if one has any questions about the condition or medications one is taking, or if one has any symptoms or side effects from the medications. If pulmonary hypertension affects the quality of life, ask the doctor about options that could help.

The drug iloprost (Ventavis) is given while one breathe in through a nebulizer, a machine that vaporizes the medication. The doctor is likely to prescribe warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to help prevent blood clots in the lung's arteries. In an atrial septostomy, a surgeon creates an opening between the upper left and right chambers of the heart (atria) to relieve the pressure on the right side of the heart. Atrial septostomy can have serious complications, including heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias). Riociguat (Adempas) increases nitric oxide in the body, which relaxes the pulmonary arteries and lowers pressure within them. Such drugs include bosentan (Tracleer), macitentan (Opsumit), and ambrisentan (Letairis). Sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra) and tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) are commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction.

The pulmonary valve normally acts like a one-way door from the heart's right ventricle to the lungs. Blood flows from the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve to the pulmonary artery and then into the lungs, where it picks up oxygen to deliver to the body. Types of pulmonary valve disease include Many types of pulmonary valve disease are due to heart conditions present at birth (congenital heart defects). Narrowing of the pulmonary valve reduces the blood flow from the heart to the pulmonary artery and lungs. The flaps (leaflets) of the pulmonary valve don't close tightly, causing blood to leak backward into the right ventricle. Instead, a solid sheet of tissue blocks blood flow from the right side of the heart, so blood can't go to the lungs to pick up oxygen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Diagram_of_the_human_heart_%28cropped%29.svg

Using a dye (contrast material) injected into the blood vessels, this test allows the doctor to view blood flow through the arteries as it happens. The doctor is able to trace the flow of the contrast material using imaging techniques, such as X-ray imaging or procedures called magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computerized tomography angiography (CTA). After finding the narrowed area of a blood vessel, the doctor can then widen it by inserting and expanding a tiny balloon or by administering medication that improves blood flow. The doctor may find signs of PAD during a physical examination, such as a weak or absent pulse below a narrowed area of the artery, whooshing sounds (bruits) over the arteries that can be heard with a stethoscope, evidence of poor wound healing in the area where the blood flow is restricted, and decreased blood pressure in the affected limb. Special ultrasound imaging techniques, such as Doppler ultrasound, can help the doctor evaluate blood flow through the blood vessels and identify blocked or narrowed arteries.",,"Many people can manage the symptoms of peripheral artery disease and stop the progression of the disease through lifestyle changes, especially quitting smoking. If one is having trouble quitting on the own, ask the doctor about smoking cessation options, including medications to help one quit.

If any part of the border has cancer cells (positive margin), or the margin between the tumor and normal tissue is close, the risk of breast cancer recurrence is increased. Most people who choose a lumpectomy (wide local excision) for breast cancer undergo breast radiation therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. Those who don't undergo the radiation therapy have an increased risk of local breast cancer recurrence. Younger people, particularly those under age 35 at the time of their original breast cancer diagnosis, face a higher risk of recurrent breast cancer. People with inflammatory breast cancer have a higher risk of local recurrence. In people who have a certain type of breast cancer, not receiving endocrine therapy can raise their risk of recurrence. If the breast cancer wasn't responsive to hormone therapy or treatments directed at the HER2 gene (triple negative breast cancer), one may have an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence.","If the doctor suspects one may have recurrent breast cancer based on results of a mammogram or physical exam, or because of signs and symptoms, he or she may recommend additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging tests may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), X-ray, bone scan or positron emission tomography (PET).

Bile reflux may accompany the reflux (backwash) of stomach acid (gastric acid) into the esophagus. Gastric reflux may lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a potentially serious problem that causes irritation and inflammation of esophageal tissue (esophagitis).","Acid reflux occurs when the sphincter muscle at the lower end of the esophagus relaxes at the wrong time, allowing stomach acid to back up into the esophagus. Bile and food mix in the duodenum and enter the small intestine through the pyloric valve, a heavy ring of muscle located at the outlet of the stomach. In many cases of bile reflux, the valve doesn't close properly, and bile washes back into the stomach. Bile and stomach acid can reflux into the esophagus when another muscular valve, the lower esophageal sphincter, malfunctions. Gastric surgery, including total removal of the stomach (gastrectomy) and gastric bypass surgery for weight loss, is responsible for most bile reflux. Stagnant food in the stomach can lead to increased gastric pressure and allow bile and stomach acid to back up into the esophagus.",,"These tests use an acid-measuring probe to identify when, and for how long, acid refluxes into the esophagus. In one test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a probe at the end is threaded through the nose into the esophagus. In another test (the Bravo test), the probe is attached to the lower portion of the esophagus during endoscopy. As in a standard probe test, esophageal impedance uses a probe that's placed into the esophagus with a catheter.",,"Unlike acid reflux, bile reflux seems unrelated to lifestyle factors. But because many people experience both acid reflux and bile reflux, the symptoms may be eased by lifestyle changes: Stop smoking. Smoking increases the production of stomach acid and dries up saliva, which helps protect the esophagus. Eating smaller, more-frequent meals reduces pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, helping to prevent the valve from opening at the wrong time. Some foods increase the production of stomach acid and may relax the lower esophageal sphincter. Among the foods with this effect are caffeinated and carbonated drinks, chocolate, citrus foods and juices, vinegar-based dressings, onions, tomato-based foods, spicy foods and mint.","Bile acid sequestrants.Doctors often prescribe bile acid sequestrants, which disrupt the circulation of bile, but studies show that these drugs are less effective than other treatments. Proton pump inhibitors.These medications are often prescribed to block acid production, but they don't have a clear role in treating bile reflux. In Roux-en-Y, surgeons make a new connection for bile drainage farther down in the small intestine, diverting bile away from the stomach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting the mouth and stomach (esophagus).","If the sphincter relaxes abnormally or weakens, stomach acid can flow back up into the esophagus. This constant backwash of acid irritates the lining of the esophagus, often causing it to become inflamed.",,"Endoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube (endoscope) down the throat and into the esophagus. A tiny camera on the end of the endoscope lets the doctor examine the esophagus, stomach and the beginning of the small intestine (duodenum). The doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube equipped with a light and camera (endoscope) down the throat, to examine the inside of the esophagus and stomach. Test results can often be normal when reflux is present, but an endoscopy may detect inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) or other complications.

Aortic valve regurgitation allows some of the blood that was pumped out of the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle) to leak back into it.","Sometimes, the valves don't open or close properly, disrupting the blood flow through the heart and potentially impairing the ability to pump blood to the body. In some cases a valve may only have one cusp (unicuspid) or four cusps (quadricuspid), but this is less common. Other rare conditions can enlarge the aorta and aortic valve and lead to regurgitation, including Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disease.",,"To diagnose aortic valve regurgitation, the doctor may review the signs and symptoms, discuss the and the family's medical history, and conduct a physical examination. The doctor may listen to the heart with a stethoscope to determine if one has a heart murmur that may indicate an aortic valve condition. The doctor may order several tests to diagnose the condition, and determine the cause and severity of the condition. It can help doctors determine the cause and severity of the condition, and see if one has additional heart valve conditions. This test isn't often used to diagnose aortic valve regurgitation, but it may be used if other tests aren't able to diagnose the condition or determine its severity. Doctors may also conduct cardiac catheterization prior to valve replacement surgery to see if there are obstructions in the coronary arteries, so they can be fixed at the time of the valve surgery. In cardiac catheterization, a doctor threads a thin tube (catheter) through a blood vessel in the arm or groin to an artery in the heart and injects dye through the catheter to make the artery visible on an X-ray. Exercise tests help doctors see whether one has signs and symptoms of aortic valve disease during physical activity, and these tests can help determine the severity of the condition.",,"While lifestyle changes can't prevent or treat the condition, the doctor might suggest that one incorporate several heart-healthy lifestyle changes into the life.

"Regurgitation , mitral valve",https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mitral-valve-regurgitation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350178,,"Mitral valve regurgitation also called mitral regurgitation, mitral insufficiency or mitral incompetence is a condition in which the heart's mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. Left untreated, severe mitral valve regurgitation can cause heart failure or heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias).","Sometimes, the valves don't open or close properly, disrupting the blood flow through the heart to the body. The mitral valve separates the two chambers (atrium and ventricle) of the left side of the heart. In mitral valve prolapse, the leaflets of the mitral valve bulge (prolapse) into the left atrium like a parachute during the heart's contraction. Sometimes mitral valve prolapse causes blood to leak back into the atrium from the ventricle, which is called mitral valve regurgitation. Mitral valve regurgitation can be caused by problems with the mitral valve, also called primary mitral valve regurgitation. In this condition, the mitral valve's leaflets bulge back into the left atrium during the heart's contraction. This common heart defect can prevent the mitral valve from closing tightly and lead to regurgitation. Rheumatic fever a complication of untreated strep throat can damage the mitral valve, leading to mitral valve regurgitation early or later in life. The mitral valve may be damaged by an infection of the lining of the heart (endocarditis) that can involve heart valves. A heart attack can damage the area of the heart muscle that supports the mitral valve, affecting the function of the valve. If the damage is extensive enough, a heart attack can cause sudden and severe mitral valve regurgitation. Experiencing trauma, such as in a car accident, can lead to mitral valve regurgitation. In rare cases, radiation therapy for cancer that is focused on the chest area can lead to mitral valve regurgitation. Atrial fibrillation is a common heart rhythm problem that can be a potential cause of mitral valve regurgitation.","Several factors can increase the risk of mitral valve regurgitation, including A history of mitral valve prolapse or mitral valve stenosis. However, having either condition doesn't necessarily mean one will develop mitral valve regurgitation. A heart attack can damage the heart, affecting the function of the mitral valve. Certain forms of heart disease, such as coronary artery disease, can lead to mitral valve regurgitation. People who take drugs containing ergotamine (Cafergot, Migergot) and similar medicines for migraines or who take cabergoline have an increased risk of mitral regurgitation. By middle age, many people have some mitral valve regurgitation caused by natural deterioration of the valve.","Mitral valve regurgitation usually produces a sound of blood leaking backward through the mitral valve (heart murmur). In this test, sound waves directed at the heart from a wandlike device (transducer) held on the chest produce video images of the heart in motion. This test assesses the structure of the heart, the mitral valve and the blood flow through the heart. In this test, a small transducer attached to the end of a tube is inserted down the esophagus, which allows a closer look at the mitral valve than a regular echocardiogram does. This test may be used to determine the severity of the condition and assess the size and function of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle). Cardiac CT. A CT angiogram may be performed of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to determine whether one is a candidate for robotic mitral valve repair. This invasive technique involves threading a thin tube (catheter) through a blood vessel in the arm or groin to an artery in the heart and injecting dye through the catheter to make the artery visible on an X-ray.",,"The doctor may suggest one incorporate several heart-healthy lifestyle changes into the life, including If one is a woman with mitral valve regurgitation, it's important to talk to the doctor before one become pregnant. If one has had a heart valve replaced, the doctor may recommend one take antibiotics before dental procedures to prevent an infection called infective endocarditis. Excessive alcohol use can also cause cardiomyopathy, a condition of weakened heart muscle that leads to mitral regurgitation. Ask the doctor for guidance before starting to exercise, especially if one is considering competitive sports.","Doctors may suggest mitral valve repair or replacement even if one isn't experiencing symptoms, as this may prevent complications and improve outcomes. If one need surgery for another heart condition, the doctor may repair or replace the diseased mitral valve at the same time. In some cases, doctors may conduct minimally invasive heart surgery, which involves the use of smaller incisions than those used in open-heart surgery. High blood pressure makes mitral valve regurgitation worse, so if one has high blood pressure, the doctor may prescribe medication to help lower it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Blausen_0645_MitralValve_RegurgitationvsStenosis.png

Normally, the vitreous separates from the surface of the retina without any complications a common condition called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). As the vitreous separates or peels off the retina, it may tug on the retina with enough force to create a retinal tear. Left untreated, the liquid vitreous can pass through the tear into the space behind the retina, causing the retina to become detached. This type of detachment can occur when scar tissue grows on the retina's surface, causing the retina to pull away from the back of the eye.

Untreated, some retinal diseases can cause severe vision loss or blindness. A retinal tear occurs when the clear, gel-like substance in the center of the eye (vitreous) shrinks and tugs on the thin layer of tissue lining the back of the eye (retina) with enough traction to cause a break in the tissue.

Rett syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rett-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377227,"Rett syndrome signs and symptoms include Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages: Signs and symptoms of Rett syndrome can be subtle in the early stages. See the child's doctor right away if one begin to notice physical problems or changes in behavior after apparently normal development, such as: Slowed growth. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Children with Rett syndrome typically develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements that may differ for each person. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. These include breath-holding, abnormally rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forceful exhalation of air or saliva, and swallowing air. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Abnormal sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may have limited improvement, with less crying and irritability, and some improvement in hand use and communication. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often.","Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops, causing a progressive loss of motor skills and speech. Most babies with Rett syndrome seem to develop normally for the first 6 to 18 months of age, and then lose skills they previously had such as the ability to crawl, walk, communicate or use their hands. Current treatment focuses on improving movement and communication, treating seizures, and providing care and support for children and adults with Rett syndrome and their families.","Classic Rett syndrome, as well as several variants with milder or more-severe symptoms, can occur based on the specific genetic mutation. Because males have a different chromosome combination from females, boys who have the genetic mutation that causes Rett syndrome are affected in devastating ways. Similar to girls with Rett syndrome, these boys will likely live to adulthood, but they're still at risk of a number of intellectual and developmental problems.",,"If the child's doctor suspects Rett syndrome after evaluation, he or she may recommend a genetic test (DNA analysis) to confirm the diagnosis. Other genetic disorders Autism Cerebral palsy Hearing or vision problems Metabolic disorders, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) Disorders that cause the brain or body to break down (degenerative disorders) Brain disorders caused by trauma or infection Brain damage before birth (prenatal) Blood tests Urine tests Imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scans Hearing tests Eye and vision exams Brain activity tests (electroencephalograms, also called EEGs) Partial or complete loss of purposeful hand skills Partial or complete loss of spoken language Walking abnormalities, such as problems walking or not being able to walk Repetitive purposeless hand movements, such as hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping or tapping, putting hands in the mouth, or washing and rubbing movements CT scan EEG (electroencephalogram) Eye exam Genetic testing MRI Urinalysis","Although there is no cure for Rett syndrome, treatments are directed toward symptoms and providing support, which may improve the potential for movement, communication and social participation. Treatments that can help children and adults with Rett syndrome include A few examples of complementary therapies that have been tried in children with Rett syndrome include Although there's not much evidence that these approaches are effective, they may offer opportunities for increased movement and social and recreational enrichment. If one think alternative or complementary therapies might help the child, talk to the doctor or therapist about the possible benefits and risks, and how the approach might fit into the medical treatment plan. Children and adults with Rett syndrome need help with most daily tasks, such as eating, walking and using the bathroom. Though medications can't cure Rett syndrome, they may help control some signs and symptoms associated with the disorder, such as seizures, muscle stiffness, or problems with breathing, sleep, the gastrointestinal tract or the heart. In some cases, physical therapy can also help maintain movement, create a proper sitting position, and improve walking skills, balance and flexibility. If repetitive arm and hand movements are a problem, splints that restrict elbow or wrist motion may be helpful.

Secondary hypertension,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/secondary-hypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20350679,,"Secondary hypertension (secondary high blood pressure) is high blood pressure that's caused by another medical condition. Secondary hypertension differs from the usual type of high blood pressure (primary hypertension or essential hypertension), which is often referred to simply as high blood pressure. Proper treatment of secondary hypertension can often control both the underlying condition and the high blood pressure, which reduces the risk of serious complications including heart disease, kidney failure and strokes.","Several kidney diseases may cause secondary hypertension, including Renovascular hypertension. Not getting enough oxygen may damage the lining of the blood vessel walls, which may make the blood vessels less effective in regulating the blood pressure. In addition, sleep apnea causes part of the nervous system to be overactive and release certain chemicals that increase blood pressure. This puts added pressure on the artery walls, increasing the blood pressure. In addition, fat deposits can release chemicals that raise blood pressure. Many illegal drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, also increase blood pressure. Diabetes can damage the kidneys filtering system, which can lead to high blood pressure. In this inherited condition, cysts in the kidneys prevent the kidneys from working normally and can raise blood pressure. If the swollen glomeruli can't work normally, one may develop high blood pressure. This makes the kidneys retain salt and water and lose too much potassium, which raises blood pressure. When the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), high blood pressure can result. If the glands secrete too much parathyroid hormone, the amount of calcium in the blood rises which triggers a rise in blood pressure. This, in turn, raises blood pressure particularly in the arms. Pregnancy can make existing high blood pressure worse, or may cause high blood pressure to develop (pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia).",,"To diagnose secondary hypertension, the doctor will first take a blood pressure reading using an inflatable cuff, just as the blood pressure is measured during a typical doctor's appointment. The doctor may not diagnose secondary hypertension based on only one higher than normal blood pressure reading. It may take three to six high blood pressure measurements at separate appointments to diagnose secondary hypertension. Since many kidney conditions are linked to secondary hypertension, the doctor may order an ultrasound of the kidneys and blood vessels. The doctor may want to check the potassium, sodium, creatinine, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglycerides, and other chemicals in the blood to help make a diagnosis. The doctor may want to check the urine for markers that could show the high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition.","Often, however, lifestyle changes such as eating healthy foods, increasing physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight can help keep the blood pressure low. One may need to continue to take blood pressure medication as well, and any underlying medical condition one has may affect the doctor's choice of medication. Diuretics, sometimes called water pills, are medications that act on the kidneys to help the body eliminate sodium and water, reducing blood volume. If one is not taking a diuretic and the blood pressure remains high, talk to the doctor about adding one or replacing a drug one currently take with a diuretic. These medications reduce the workload on the heart and open the blood vessels, causing the heart to beat slower and with less force. When prescribed alone, beta blockers don't work as well in black people but they're effective when combined with a thiazide diuretic. ACE inhibitors may be especially important in treating high blood pressure in people with coronary artery disease, heart failure or kidney failure. Like beta blockers, ACE inhibitors don't work as well in black people when prescribed alone, but they're effective when combined with a thiazide diuretic. Like ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers often are useful for people with coronary artery disease, heart failure or kidney failure. Grapefruit juice interacts with some calcium channel blockers, increasing blood levels of the medication and putting one at higher risk of side effects. Although lowering secondary hypertension can be difficult, making the same lifestyle changes one would make if one had primary high blood pressure can help. A lower sodium level 1,500 milligrams (mg) a day is appropriate for people 51 years of age and older and for people of any age who are black or who have hypertension, diabetes or chronic kidney disease. At that point, the primary care doctor may order more tests or refer one to a doctor who specializes in treating whatever the suspected underlying cause of the high blood pressure may be. For example, if the doctor believes that a kidney problem is causing the high blood pressure, one will likely be referred to a doctor who specializes in treating kidney disorders (nephrologist). Get plenty of potassium, which is found in fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, spinach, bananas and apricots, to help prevent and control high blood pressure. If one is overweight, losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can lower the blood pressure.","Although lowering secondary hypertension can be difficult, making the same lifestyle changes one would make if one had primary high blood pressure can help.

These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms.",,"Some types of epilepsy, which are categorized by the type of seizure one experience or the part of the brain that is affected, run in families. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Brain conditions that cause damage to the brain, such as brain tumors or strokes, can cause epilepsy. Infectious diseases, such as meningitis, AIDS and viral encephalitis, can cause epilepsy.","If one has a family history of epilepsy, one may be at an increased risk of developing a seizure disorder. One can reduce the risk by wearing a seat belt while riding in a car and by wearing a helmet while bicycling, skiing, riding a motorcycle or engaging in other activities with a high risk of head injury. One can take a number of steps to reduce the risk of these diseases, including limiting the intake of alcohol and avoiding cigarettes, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. The risk of epilepsy increases if a child has a long seizure, another nervous system condition or a family history of epilepsy.","The evaluation may include An electroencephalogram (EEG) can show irregular activity in the brain that can indicate seizures. EEG results show changes in brain activity that may be useful in diagnosing brain conditions, especially epilepsy and other seizure disorders. The doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: Electroencephalogram (EEG). The doctor may monitor one on video when conducting an EEG while one is awake or asleep, to record any seizures one experience. The doctor may give one instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in the brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. Along with the test results, the doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: Accurate diagnosis of the seizure type and where seizures begin gives one the best chance for finding an effective treatment. High-density EEG may help the doctor more precisely determine which areas of the brain are affected by seizures. SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin.

A low level of adrenal hormones caused by damage to the pituitary gland is called secondary adrenal insufficiency.",,"Also, be sure to tell the doctor if one didn't produce breast milk or one failed to start menstruating after delivery two key signs of Sheehan's syndrome. One might need stimulation testing of the pituitary hormones, which involves injecting hormones and running repeated blood tests to see how the pituitary responds. One might also need imaging tests, such as an MRI scan or CT scan, to check the size of the pituitary gland and to look for other possible reasons for the symptoms, such as a pituitary tumor.","Hydrocortisone (Cortef) or prednisone (Rayos), replace the adrenal hormones that aren't being produced because of an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency. Preparations containing luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), also called gonadotropins, might make future pregnancies possible.

The clinical examination, with various autonomic tests and imaging studies, can help the doctor determine whether the diagnosis is probable MSA or possible MSA. However, doctors are increasingly aware of the disease and more likely to use physical examination and autonomic tests to determine if MSA is the most likely cause of the symptoms. If the doctor suspects multiple system atrophy, he or she will obtain a medical history, perform a physical examination and possibly order blood tests. Brain imaging scans, such as an MRI, can show signs that may suggest MSA and also help determine if there are other causes that may be contributing to the symptoms. Doctors may order other tests to assess the body's involuntary functions, including If one has sleep irregularities, especially interrupted breathing or snoring, the doctor may recommend an evaluation in a sleep laboratory.","To treat specific signs and symptoms, the doctor may recommend: Medications to raise blood pressure. Midodrine (Orvaten) can raise the blood pressure quickly; however, it needs to be taken carefully as it can elevate pressure while lying down. Certain medications used to treat Parkinson's disease, such as combined levodopa and carbidopa (Duopa, Sinemet, others), can be used to reduce Parkinson's disease-like signs and symptoms, such as stiffness, balance problems and slowness of movement. Impotence can be treated with a variety of drugs, such as sildenafil (Revatio, Viagra), designed to manage erectile dysfunction. In advanced MSA, one may require a tube (gastrostomy tube) that delivers food directly into the stomach. Eventually, when the disease becomes advanced, one may need to have a soft tube (catheter) inserted permanently to allow one to drain the bladder.","Doctors often advise using certain self-care measures to help minimize MSA symptoms, such as: Take steps to raise the blood pressure. Salt and fluids can increase blood volume and raise the blood pressure. Drink coffee and other caffeinated fluids to raise the blood pressure. Raising the head of the bed by about 4 to 6 inches will minimize increases in blood pressure when one sleep.

Sick sinus syndrome,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sick-sinus-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377554,,,"In a normal heart rhythm, a tiny cluster of cells at the sinus node sends out an electrical signal. The rhythm of the heart is normally controlled by the sinus node, an area of specialized cells in the right upper heart chamber (atrium). From the sinus node, electrical signals travel across the atria to the ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood to the lungs and body. Signals from the sinus node pause, causing skipped beats. Signals to the upper heart chambers are slowed or blocked, causing a pause or skipped beats. The heart rate alternates between abnormally slow and fast rhythms, usually with a long pause (asystole) between heartbeats.",,"Electrodes are placed on the chest to record the heart's electrical signals, which cause the heart to beat. Symptoms of sick sinus syndrome such as dizziness, shortness of breath and fainting only occur when the heart is beating abnormally. To determine if the symptoms are related to problems with the sinus node and heart function, the doctor may use the following tests: This test is rarely used to screen for sick sinus syndrome. During this test, thin, flexible tubes (catheters) tipped with electrodes are threaded through the blood vessels to various spots along the electrical pathways in the heart. Once in place, the electrodes can precisely map the spread of electrical impulses during each beat and may identify the source of heart rhythm problems. During this test, sensors (electrodes) are attached to the chest and legs to create a record of the electrical signals traveling through the heart. The test might show patterns that indicate sick sinus syndrome, including a fast heart rate, slow heart rate or long pause in the heartbeat after a fast heart rate. It automatically records the heart's activity for 24 to 72 hours, which provides the doctor with an extended look at the heart rhythms. This portable ECG, which may be worn up to a month, enables the doctor to correlate symptoms and heart rhythm. This small ECG device is implanted just under the skin of the chest and is used for continuous, long-term monitoring of the heart's electrical activity, particularly if one has infrequent symptoms.",,"One many not necessarily prevent sick sinus syndrome, but one can take steps to keep the heart as healthy as possible and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease: Exercise and eat a healthy diet.

Sickle cell anemia,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876,"Sickle cells break apart easily and die, leaving one with too few red blood cells. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen, causing fatigue. Periodic episodes of pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to the chest, abdomen and joints. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood flow to the hands and feet. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, leaving one more vulnerable to infections. Doctors commonly give infants and children with sickle cell anemia vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk of serious infection, and fever can be the first sign of an infection.","Normal red blood cells are rounded and disk-shaped. In sickle cell anemia, some red blood cells become deformed, so they look like sickles used to cut wheat. Sickle cell anemia is an inherited red blood cell disorder in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body.",,,,,"Taking the following steps to stay healthy may help one avoid complications of sickle cell anemia: Take folic acid supplements daily, and choose a healthy diet. Use OTC pain medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, Children's Motrin, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve), sparingly, if at all, because of the possible effect on the kidneys. Take folic acid supplements daily, and choose a healthy diet.","Doing so helps prevent infections, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening to children with sickle cell anemia. Adults who have sickle cell anemia may need to take penicillin throughout their lives, if theyve had pneumonia or surgery to remove the spleen. In a red blood cell transfusion, red blood cells are removed from a supply of donated blood, then given through a vein to a person with sickle cell anemia. This increases the number of normal red blood cells, which helps reduce symptoms and complications. Also known as bone marrow transplant, this procedure involves replacing bone marrow affected by sickle cell anemia with healthy bone marrow from a donor. The procedure usually uses a matched donor, such as a sibling, who doesn't have sickle cell anemia. Because of the risks associated with a bone marrow transplant, the procedure is recommended only for people, usually children, who have significant symptoms and complications of sickle cell anemia.","Hematology, medical genetics","Attacks of pain, anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, stroke",5â€“6 months of age,,Genetic,,Blood test,,"Vaccination, antibiotics, high fluid intake, folic acid supplementation, pain medication, blood transfusions",Life expectancy 40â€“60 years (developed world),4.4 million (2015),,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/1911_Sickle_Cells.jpg

People living closer to the earth's equator, where the sun's rays are more direct, experience higher amounts of UV radiation than do those living farther north or south.","To determine whether a suspicious skin lesion is melanoma, the doctor may recommend removing a sample of skin for testing. If the melanoma is thicker, the doctor may recommend additional tests to see if the cancer has spread before determining the treatment options. If there's a risk that the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, the doctor may recommend a procedure known as a sentinel node biopsy. If these first lymph nodes (sentinel lymph nodes) are cancer-free, there's a good chance that the melanoma has not spread beyond the area where it was first discovered. Other factors may go into determining the risk that the cancer may spread (metastasize), including whether the skin over the area has formed an open sore (ulceration) and how many dividing cancer cells (mitoses) are found when looking under a microscope. For people with more-advanced melanomas, doctors may recommend imaging tests to look for signs that the cancer has spread to other areas of the body.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Basal_cell_carcinoma.jpg

People with narcolepsy often transition quickly to REM sleep, usually within 15 minutes of falling asleep.","Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and sudden attacks of sleep. Sometimes, narcolepsy can be accompanied by a sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), which can be triggered by strong emotion.","Exactly what causes the loss of hypocretin-producing cells in the brain isn't known, but experts suspect it's due to an autoimmune reaction. The normal process of falling asleep begins with a phase called non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. After an hour or so of NREM sleep, the brain activity changes, and REM sleep begins. In narcolepsy, however, one may suddenly enter into REM sleep without first experiencing NREM sleep, both at night and during the day.",,"The doctor may make a preliminary diagnosis of narcolepsy based on the excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy). One may be asked to keep a detailed diary of the sleep pattern for a week or two, so the doctor can compare how the sleep pattern and alertness are related. Other sleep disorders, such as chronic sleep deprivation, the use of sedating medications and sleep apnea, can cause excessive daytime sleepiness.

Small intestine prolapse,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/enterocele/symptoms-causes/syc-20377661,,"Small bowel prolapse (enterocele) occurs when muscles and tissues that hold the intestines (small bowel) in place inside the pelvic cavity weaken, causing the small bowel to descend and bulge into the vagina. Small bowel prolapse, also called enterocele (EN-tur-o-seel), occurs when the small intestine (small bowel) descends into the lower pelvic cavity and pushes at the top part of the vagina, creating a bulge.",,"Factors that increase the risk of developing small bowel prolapse include Pregnancy and childbirth. Vaginal delivery of one or more children contributes to the weakening of the pelvic floor support structures, increasing the risk of prolapse. The more pregnancies one has, the greater the risk of developing any type of pelvic organ prolapse. Small bowel prolapse and other types of pelvic organ prolapse occur more often with increasing age. Removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) or surgical procedures to treat incontinence may increase the risk of developing small bowel prolapse. Being overweight increases pressure inside the abdomen, which increases the risk of developing small bowel prolapse. For unknown reasons, Hispanic and white women are at higher risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse. One may be genetically prone to prolapse due to weaker connective tissues in the pelvic area, making one naturally more susceptible to small bowel prolapse and other types of pelvic organ prolapse.",,,"Depending on the severity of the condition, these self-care measures may provide the symptom relief one need: Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, which, in part, support the uterus, bladder and bowel. A strong pelvic floor provides better support for the pelvic organs, prevents prolapse from worsening and relieves symptoms associated with pelvic organ prolapse. To perform Kegel exercises, follow these steps: Ask the doctor for feedback on whether one is using the right muscles. Biofeedback involves using monitoring devices that help ensure one is tightening the proper muscles, with optimal intensity and length of time. Once one has learned the proper method, one can do Kegel exercises discreetly just about anytime, whether one is sitting at the desk or relaxing on the couch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/BudgieProlapse.png
Small vessel disease,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-vessel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352117,,,,,"Because large vessel coronary artery disease and small vessel disease have the same signs and symptoms, it's likely the doctor will check the main arteries in the heart first. To diagnose small vessel disease, the doctor will also ask one about the medical history and family history of heart disease. If the doctor can't find blockages in the main arteries based on these tests, one might have an additional test to check for blockages in the smaller arteries of the heart: Endothelial dysfunction test. To test endothelial function, a wire is threaded through a catheter inserted in one of the coronary arteries and a medication is injected into the artery that causes the small vessels in the heart to open. A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of the heart through a catheter a long, thin tube that's fed through an artery, usually in the groin, to arteries in the heart. This test, which uses a radioactive dye and medication, can show the heart's blood flow to other parts of the body.","The treatment for small vessel disease involves medications to control the narrowing of the small blood vessels that could lead to a heart attack and to relieve pain. This amino acid that's normally used by the body to help metabolize protein may help treat symptoms of small vessel disease by relaxing the blood vessels. If one has had chest pains or other symptoms of heart disease, the primary care provider will likely refer one to a doctor trained in treating disorders of the heart and circulatory system (cardiologist). These drugs, such as propranolol (Inderal, Innopran XL, others) and bisoprolol (Zebeta), slow the heart rate and decrease the blood pressure. Drugs such as verapamil (Verelan, Calan, others) and diltiazem (Cardizem, Diltzac, others) relax the muscles around the coronary arteries and cause the vessels to open, increasing blood flow to the heart. Medications such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and simvastatin (Zocor) help lower cholesterol, which contributes to the narrowing of the arteries. Medications such as benazepril (Lotensin) and lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril) help open the blood vessels and lower the blood pressure. Medications such as azilsartan (Edarbi) and losartan (Cozaar) relax the blood vessels, which lowers the blood pressure and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Edit-copy_purple-wikit.svg
Snoring,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/snoring/symptoms-causes/syc-20377694,"Snoring is often associated with a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). People with obstructive sleep apnea usually experience periods when breathing slows or stops at least five times during every hour of sleep. These may indicate the snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nose and throat problems such as enlarged tonsils and obesity often can narrow a child's airway, which can lead to the child developing OSA.",,"Snoring occurs when air flows past relaxed tissues, such as the tongue, soft palate and airway, as one breathe. The sagging tissues narrow the airway, causing these tissues to vibrate. People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the back of their throats that may narrow their airways. Likewise, if the triangular piece of tissue hanging from the soft palate (uvula) is elongated, airflow can be obstructed and vibration increased. Snoring is typically most frequent and loudest when sleeping on the back as gravity's effect on the throat narrows the airway.","Some people may have a long soft palate, or large tonsils or adenoids, which can narrow the airway and cause snoring. Alcohol relaxes the throat muscles, increasing the risk of snoring. If one has a structural defect in the airway, such as a deviated septum, or the nose is chronically congested, the risk of snoring is greater.","Depending on the severity of the snoring and other symptoms, the doctor may want to conduct a sleep study. However, depending upon the other medical problems and other sleep symptoms, one may need to stay overnight at a sleep center to undergo an in-depth analysis of the breathing during sleep by a study, called a polysomnography.",,"To prevent or quiet snoring, Treat nasal congestion or obstruction. Adhesive strips applied to the bridge of the nose help many people increase the area of their nasal passage, enhancing their breathing. A nasal dilator is a stiffened adhesive strip applied externally across the nostrils that may help decrease airflow resistance so one breathe easier. Nasal strips and external nasal dilators aren't effective for people with OSA, however. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages at least two hours before bedtime, and let the doctor know about the snoring before taking sedatives.",,"Otorhinolaryngology, sleep medicine",,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Action_photo_of_nasal_spray_on_a_black_background.jpg

The neural tube is the structure in a developing embryo that eventually becomes the baby's brain, spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube doesn't close or develop properly, causing defects in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine. Myelomeningocele is a severe type of spina bifida in which the membranes and the spinal nerves protrude at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back.

If one plan ahead, some medications can be adjusted to diminish the potential risk of spina bifida. A folate deficiency increases the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. In addition, a woman who was born with a neural tube defect has a greater chance of giving birth to a child with spina bifida. For example, anti-seizure medications, such as valproic acid (Depakene), seem to cause neural tube defects when taken during pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with an increased risk of neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida. Elevating the core body temperature, due to fever or using a sauna or hot tub, has been associated with a possible slightly increased risk of spina bifida.","If one is pregnant, one will be offered prenatal screening tests to check for spina bifida and other birth defects. Spina bifida can be screened with maternal blood tests, but typically the diagnosis is made with ultrasound. An advanced ultrasound also can detect signs of spina bifida, such as an open spine or particular features in the baby's brain that indicate spina bifida. If the prenatal ultrasound confirms the diagnosis of spina bifida, the doctor may request amniocentesis. For the MSAFP test, a sample of the mother's blood is drawn and tested for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) a protein produced by the baby.

This narrowing prevents the valve from opening fully, which reduces or blocks blood flow from the heart into the main artery to the body (aorta) and onward to the rest of the body. When the blood flow through the aortic valve is reduced or blocked, the heart needs to work harder to pump blood to the body.","Aortic valve stenosis is a defect that narrows or obstructs the aortic valve opening, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood into the aorta. Sometimes, the valves don't open or close properly, disrupting the blood flow through the heart and potentially impairing the ability to pump blood to the body. Aortic valve stenosis can occur due to many causes, including Congenital heart defect. With age, heart valves may accumulate deposits of calcium (aortic valve calcification). As blood repeatedly flows over the aortic valve, deposits of calcium can build up on the valve's cusps. However, aortic valve stenosis that is related to increasing age and the buildup of calcium deposits on the aortic valve is most common in older people. A complication of strep throat infection, rheumatic fever may result in scar tissue forming on the aortic valve. Scar tissue can also create a rough surface on which calcium deposits can collect, contributing to aortic valve stenosis later in life.

In rare cases, other tests to evaluate the quality of the sperm may be performed, such as evaluating a semen specimen for DNA abnormalities. X-ray contrast is injected into the uterus, and an X-ray is taken to determine if the cavity is normal and to see if the fluid spills out of the fallopian tubes. During the procedure, the doctor inserts a thin, lighted device through the cervix into the uterus to view any potential abnormalities.

Temporal arteritis,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372758,,"Giant cell arteritis is an inflammation of the lining of the arteries. Giant cell arteritis frequently causes headaches, scalp tenderness, jaw pain and vision problems. Prompt treatment with corticosteroid medications usually relieves symptoms of giant cell arteritis and might prevent loss of vision.","This swelling narrows the blood vessels, reducing the amount of blood and, therefore, oxygen and vital nutrients that reaches the body's tissues. What causes these arteries to become inflamed isn't known, but it's thought to involve abnormal attacks on artery walls by the immune system.","Several factors can increase the risk of developing giant cell arteritis, including Age. Giant cell arteritis affects adults only, and rarely those under 50. Giant cell arteritis is most common among white people in Northern European populations or of Scandinavian descent. Having polymyalgia rheumatica puts one at increased risk of developing giant cell arteritis.","Tests might include The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. If one has giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. If the results aren't clear, the doctor might advise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of the head. Commonly referred to as the sed rate, this test measures how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube of blood. If the doctor suspects one might have giant cell arteritis in large arteries, such as the aorta, he or she might recommend PET.","Because immediate treatment is necessary to prevent vision loss, the doctor is likely to start medication even before confirming the diagnosis with a biopsy. If one has visual loss before starting treatment with corticosteroids, it's unlikely that the vision will improve. After the first month, the doctor might gradually begin to lower the dosage until one reach the lowest dose of corticosteroids needed to control inflammation. To counter potential side effects, the doctor is likely to monitor the bone density and might prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements or other medications to help prevent bone loss. The symptoms will likely improve quickly after beginning corticosteroid treatment, and the vision isn't likely to be affected. Eating well can help prevent potential problems, such as thinning bones, high blood pressure and diabetes. Be sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D. Experts recommend 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium and 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day for women over 50 and men over 70.

To decrease pain, muscle spasm and swelling, apply ice to the injured area for up to 20 minutes several times a day. Ice packs, ice massage or slush baths with ice and water all can help. For an ice massage, freeze a plastic foam cup full of water so that one can hold the cup while applying the ice directly to the skin.

The extra X chromosome that occurs in Klinefelter syndrome causes abnormal development of the testicles, which in turn results in underproduction of testosterone. If not corrected in early childhood, it can lead to malfunction of the testicles and reduced production of testosterone. In secondary hypogonadism, the testicles are normal but don't function properly due to a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus. A number of conditions can cause secondary hypogonadism, including Pituitary disorders. An abnormality in the pituitary gland can impair the release of hormones from the pituitary gland to the testicles, affecting normal testosterone production. A pituitary tumor or other type of brain tumor located near the pituitary gland may cause testosterone or other hormone deficiencies. Also, treatment for a brain tumor, such as surgery or radiation therapy, can affect the pituitary gland and cause hypogonadism. This type of hypogonadism indicates a problem in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland parts of the brain that signal the testicles to produce testosterone.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350188,"Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly and usually without symptoms, making them difficult to detect. When they occur in the chest, they're called thoracic aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the thoracic aorta, including near the heart, in the aortic arch and in the lower part of the thoracic aorta. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are less common than aneurysms that form in the lower part of the aorta (abdominal aortic aneurysms). Most people with aortic aneurysms don't have symptoms unless a tear or rupture occurs.",A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the upper part of the aorta the major blood vessel that feeds blood to the body. A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the major blood vessel that feeds blood to the body (aorta).,"Other family-related disorders can cause an aortic aneurysm, including vascular Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz and Turner syndromes. An aortic aneurysm occurs when a weak spot in the wall of the aorta begins to bulge (left). Having an aneurysm increases the risk of rupture or an aortic dissection a tear in the lining of the aorta, shown in the image on the right. In aortic dissection, a tear occurs in the wall of the aorta. This causes bleeding into and along the aortic wall and, in some cases, completely outside the aorta (rupture). An aortic dissection is a potential life-threatening emergency, depending on where in the aorta it occurs. Inflammatory conditions, such as giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms. Sometimes people who have problems with the valve that blood flows through as it leaves the heart (aortic valve) have an increased risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm. Though rare, it's possible to develop a thoracic aortic aneurysm if one has had an untreated infection, such as syphilis or salmone willa. Rarely, some people who are injured in falls or motor vehicle crashes develop thoracic aortic aneurysms.","Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk factors include Age. Thoracic aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older. Tobacco use is a strong risk factor for the development of an aortic aneurysm. Increased blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the body, raising the chances of developing an aneurysm. People who have a family history of aortic aneurysm are at increased risk of having one. A family history means one may develop aneurysms at a younger age and one is at higher risk of rupture. If one has Marfan syndrome or a related condition, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, one has a significantly higher risk of a thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic or other blood vessel dissection or rupture.","Thoracic aortic aneurysms are often found during routine medical tests, such as a chest X-ray, CT scan or ultrasound of the heart, sometimes ordered for a different reason. The doctor may recommend screening if a first-degree relative such as a parent, sibling, son or daughter has Marfan syndrome or another condition that could cause a thoracic aortic aneurysm. One downside of the use of a CT in detecting and following aortic aneurysms is the exposure to radiation, particularly for people who require frequent monitoring, such as those with Marfan syndrome. This test may be an alternative to CT scans for people who need frequent monitoring of aneurysms, to reduce their exposure to radiation. If one has a family history of aneurysm or another suspected genetic condition that raises the risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm, one may want to consider genetic testing.",,"If one has been diagnosed with a thoracic aortic aneurysm, the doctor will likely advise one to avoid heavy lifting and some vigorous physical activities, as these can increase blood pressure, putting additional pressure on the aneurysm. If one want to participate in a particular activity, ask the doctor if it would be possible to perform an exercise stress test to see how much exercise raises the blood pressure. If one is going through a particularly emotional time in the life, let the doctor know because the medications may need to be adjusted to keep the blood pressure levels from going too high. There are no medications one can take to prevent an aortic aneurysm, although taking medications to control the blood pressure and cholesterol level may reduce the risk of having complications from a thoracic aortic aneurysm. If one is at risk, the doctor may recommend treatment, including medications to lower the blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries.","Examples of beta blockers include metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL, Kapspargo Sprinkle), atenolol (Tenormin) and bisoprolol. Examples of angiotensin II receptor blockers include losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan) and olmesartan (Benicar).",Cardiology,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/AneurysmT.PNG

Thoracic outlet syndrome is a group of disorders that occur when blood vessels or nerves in the space between the collarbone and the first rib (thoracic outlet) are compressed. Common causes of thoracic outlet syndrome include physical trauma from a car accident, repetitive injuries from job- or sports-related activities, certain anatomical defects (such as having an extra rib), and pregnancy.","In general, the cause of thoracic outlet syndrome is compression of the nerves or blood vessels in the thoracic outlet, just under the collarbone (clavicle). Drooping the shoulders or holding the head in a forward position can cause compression in the thoracic outlet area. A traumatic event, such as a car accident, can cause internal changes that then compress the nerves in the thoracic outlet. Athletes, such as baseball pitchers and swimmers, also can develop thoracic outlet syndrome from years of repetitive movements. Because joints loosen during pregnancy, signs of thoracic outlet syndrome may first appear while one is pregnant.",,"To diagnose thoracic outlet syndrome, the doctor may review the symptoms and medical history and conduct a physical examination. The tests may help the doctor determine the cause of the condition and help rule out other causes that may have similar symptoms. In these tests, the doctor may ask one to move the arms, neck or shoulders in various positions. To confirm the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome, the doctor may order one or more of the following tests: Arteriography and venography. In these tests, the doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube (catheter) through a small incision, usually in the groin. The doctor will perform a physical examination to look for external signs of thoracic outlet syndrome, such as a depression in the shoulder, swelling or pale discoloration in the arm, abnormal pulses, or limited range of motion. The doctor may order an X-ray of the affected area, which may reveal an extra rib (cervical rib). The doctor may use an MRI to determine the location and cause of blood vessel (vascular) compression. An MRI may reveal congenital anomalies, such as a fibrous band connecting the spine to the rib or a cervical rib, which may be the cause of the symptoms.","If one has venous or arterial thoracic outlet syndrome and have blood clots, the doctor may administer clot-dissolving medications (thrombolytics) into the veins or arteries to dissolve blood clots.

Thyroid gland enlargement,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/goiter/symptoms-causes/syc-20351829,,,"The thyroid gland produces two main hormones thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). The thyroid gland also produces calcitonin a hormone that helps regulate the amount of calcium in the blood. The thyroid gland, in turn, regulates its production of hormones based on the amount of TSH it receives from the pituitary gland. Even when it's enlarged, the thyroid may produce normal amounts of hormones. This can be caused by single or multiple nodules (lumps) in the thyroid, or by an autoimmune process. Iodine is essential for the production of thyroid hormones, and is found primarily in seawater and in the soil in coastal areas. But instead of causing the thyroid to produce too much hormone, Hashimoto's damages the thyroid so that it produces too little. Sensing a low hormone level, the pituitary gland produces more TSH to stimulate the thyroid, which then causes the gland to enlarge. A goiter can sometimes occur when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). In someone who has Graves disease, antibodies produced by the immune system mistakenly attack the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroxine. In this condition, several solid or fluid-filled lumps called nodules develop in both sides of the thyroid, resulting in overall enlargement of the gland. A hormone produced during pregnancy, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), may cause the thyroid gland to enlarge slightly.","People living in areas where iodine is in short supply and who don't have access to iodine supplements are at high risk of goiters. Because women are more prone to thyroid disorders, they're also more likely to develop goiters. For reasons that aren't entirely clear, thyroid problems are more likely to occur during pregnancy and menopause. Some medical treatments, including the heart drug amiodarone (Pacerone, others) and the psychiatric drug lithium (Lithobid, others), increase the risk. The risk increases if one has had radiation treatments to the neck or chest area or one has been exposed to radiation in a nuclear facility, test or accident.","The doctor may discover an enlarged thyroid gland simply by feeling the neck and having one swallow during a routine physical exam. Blood tests can determine the amount of hormones produced by the thyroid and pituitary glands. At the same time, the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) will be elevated because the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone. A goiter associated with an overactive thyroid usually involves a high level of thyroid hormone in the blood and a lower than normal TSH level. The time needed for the procedure may vary, depending on how long it takes the isotope to reach the thyroid gland. Thyroid scans provide information about the nature and size of the thyroid, but they're more invasive, time-consuming and expensive than ultrasound tests. The images reveal the size of the thyroid gland and whether the gland contains nodules that the doctor may not have been able to feel. During a fine-needle aspiration biopsy, ultrasound is used to guide a needle into the thyroid to obtain a tissue or fluid sample for testing.","If one has hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint) will resolve the symptoms of hypothyroidism as well as slow the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland, often decreasing the size of the goiter. If one has a goiter that is associated with hyperthyroidism, one may need medications to normalize hormone levels. Removing all or part of the thyroid gland (total or partial thyroidectomy) is an option if one has a large goiter that is uncomfortable or causes difficulty breathing or swallowing, or in some cases, if one has a nodular goiter causing hyperthyroidism. If the goiter is small and doesn't cause problems, and the thyroid is functioning normally, the doctor may suggest a wait-and-see approach. The treatment results in a diminished size of the goiter, but eventually may also cause an underactive thyroid gland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Blausen_0534_Goiter.png

If blood tests indicate hyperthyroidism, the doctor may recommend one of the following tests to help determine why the thyroid is overactive: Radioiodine uptake test. For this test, one take a small, oral dose of radioactive iodine (radioiodine) to see how much will collect in the thyroid gland. If one has hyperthyroidism and the radioiodine uptake is low, this indicates that the thyroxine stored in the gland is leaking into the bloodstream, which may mean one has thyroiditis. Ultrasound may be better at detecting thyroid nodules than other tests, and there's no exposure to any radiation.","This treatment may cause thyroid activity to slow enough to be considered underactive (hypothyroidism), and one may eventually need to take medication every day to replace thyroxine. Symptoms usually begin to improve within several weeks to months, but treatment with anti-thyroid medications typically continues at least a year and often longer. If one is pregnant or one otherwise can't tolerate anti-thyroid drugs and don't want to or can't have radioactive iodine therapy, one may be a candidate for thyroid surgery, although this is an option in only a few cases. In addition, one will need lifelong treatment with levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid, others) to supply the body with normal amounts of thyroid hormone.

Tinnitus,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tinnitus/symptoms-causes/syc-20350156,"Hearing loss can be age-related, come from a one-time exposure, or exposure to loud sounds over a lifetime. Dr. Poling says there's no scientifically proven cure for tinnitus, but there are treatment and management options. This rare type of tinnitus may be caused by a blood vessel problem, a middle ear bone condition or muscle contractions.","Tinnitus can be caused by broken or damaged hairs on auditory cells, turbulence in a carotid artery or jugular vein, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issues, and problems in the auditory processing pathways of the brain. Tinnitus isn't a condition itself it's a symptom of an underlying condition, such as age-related hearing loss, ear injury or a circulatory system disorder.","If the hairs inside the inner ear are bent or broken, they can leak random electrical impulses to the brain, causing tinnitus. Medications known to cause or worsen tinnitus include In addition, some herbal supplements can cause tinnitus, as can nicotine and caffeine. For many people, hearing worsens with age, usually starting around age 60. Loud noises, such as those from heavy equipment, chain saws and firearms, are common sources of noise-related hearing loss. Portable music devices, such as MP3 players or iPods, also can cause noise-related hearing loss if played loudly for long periods. Tinnitus caused by short-term exposure, such as attending a loud concert, usually goes away; both short- and long-term exposure to loud sound can cause permanent damage. When too much earwax accumulates, it becomes too hard to wash away naturally, causing hearing loss or irritation of the eardrum, which can lead to tinnitus. Stiffening of the bones in the middle ear (otosclerosis) may affect the hearing and cause tinnitus. Tinnitus can be an early indicator of Meniere's disease, an inner ear disorder that may be caused by abnormal inner ear fluid pressure. Head or neck trauma can affect the inner ear, hearing nerves or brain function linked to hearing. Also called vestibular schwannoma, this condition generally causes tinnitus in only one ear. Muscles in the inner ear can tense up (spasm), which can result in tinnitus, hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the ear. That causes blood flow to become more forceful, making it easier for the ear to detect the beats. A condition called arteriovenous malformation (AVM), abnormal connections between arteries and veins, can result in tinnitus.","Anyone can experience tinnitus, but these factors may increase the risk: Loud noise exposure. People who work in noisy environments such as factory and construction workers, musicians, and soldiers are particularly at risk. As one age, the number of functioning nerve fibers in the ears declines, possibly causing hearing problems often associated with tinnitus. Conditions that affect the blood flow, such as high blood pressure or narrowed arteries (atherosclerosis), can increase the risk of tinnitus.","The doctor will examine the ears, head and neck to look for possible causes of tinnitus. Depending on the suspected cause of the tinnitus, one may need imaging tests such as CT or MRI scans. Blood vessel problems, such as high blood pressure, an aneurysm or a tumor, and blockage of the ear canal or eustachian tube can amplify the sound of the heartbeat in the ears (pulsatile tinnitus). However, if there's hearing loss as well, tinnitus may be permanent. Long-term noise exposure, age-related hearing loss or medications can cause a continuous, high-pitched ringing in both ears. Acoustic neuroma can cause continuous, high-pitched ringing in one ear. Stiff inner ear bones (otosclerosis) can cause low-pitched tinnitus that may be continuous or may come and go.",,"In a quiet setting, a fan, soft music or low-volume radio static may help mask the noise from tinnitus. Stress management, whether through relaxation therapy, biofeedback or exercise, may provide some relief. Alcohol increases the force of the blood by dilating the blood vessels, causing greater blood flow, especially in the inner ear area.","However, these medications are generally used for only severe tinnitus, as they can cause troublesome side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and heart problems. Alprazolam (Xanax) may help reduce tinnitus symptoms, but side effects can include drowsiness and nausea.","Otorhinolaryngology, audiology",Hearing sound when no external sound is present,Gradual,,"Noise-induced hearing loss, ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease, brain tumors, inner ear tumors, emotional stress, traumatic brain injury, excessive earwax",,"Based on symptoms, audiogram, neurological exam",,"Counseling, sound generators, hearing aids",,~12.5%,,

Tooth decay,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cavities/symptoms-causes/syc-20352892,,"Cavities are decayed areas of the teeth that develop into tiny openings or holes. Cavities, also called tooth decay or caries, are caused by a combination of factors, including bacteria in the mouth, frequent snacking, sipping sugary drinks and not cleaning the teeth well.","When sugars and starches aren't cleaned off the teeth, bacteria quickly begin feeding on them and form plaque. The acids in plaque remove minerals in the tooth's hard, outer enamel. Once areas of enamel are worn away, the bacteria and acid can reach the next layer of the teeth, called dentin.","Everyone who has teeth is at risk of getting cavities, but the following factors can increase risk: Tooth location. Foods that cling to the teeth for a long time such as milk, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips are more likely to cause decay than foods that are easily washed away by saliva. When one steadily snack or sip sugary drinks, one give mouth bacteria more fuel to produce acids that attack the teeth and wear them down. When babies are given bedtime bottles filled with milk, formula, juice or other sugar-containing liquids, these beverages remain on their teeth for hours while they sleep, feeding decay-causing bacteria. If one don't clean the teeth soon after eating and drinking, plaque forms quickly and the first stages of decay can begin. Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, helps prevent cavities and can even reverse the earliest stages of tooth damage. Because of its benefits for teeth, fluoride is added to many public water supplies. Over time, teeth can wear down and gums may recede, making teeth more vulnerable to root decay. Older adults also may use more medications that reduce saliva flow, increasing the risk of tooth decay. Dry mouth is caused by a lack of saliva, which helps prevent tooth decay by washing away food and plaque from the teeth.

Most heart murmurs are innocent, meaning that there is no heart defect and the murmur isn't dangerous to the child's health. Some murmurs, however, may mean blood is flowing through the child's heart abnormally because he or she has a heart defect. If it's possible the child has a heart defect, the doctor or the child's doctor may order several tests to see if the child has a heart problem. The child's doctor may use a regular echocardiogram to diagnose a congenital heart defect after the child has been born. In this noninvasive test, the child's doctor performs an ultrasound to produce images of the heart. An echocardiogram allows the doctor to see the child's heart in motion and to identify abnormalities in the heart muscle and valves. In this test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at the baby's groin and guided through it into the heart. Catheterization is sometimes necessary because it may give the child's doctor a much more detailed view of the child's heart defect than an echocardiogram. This test allows the doctor to see if the child has a heart defect before he or she is born, allowing the doctor to better plan treatment. This noninvasive test records the electrical activity of the child's heart and can help diagnose heart defects or rhythm problems. The child may have a chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged, or if the lungs have extra blood or other fluid in them.","A congenital heart defect may have no long-term effect on the child's health in some instances, such defects can safely go untreated. Depending on the type of heart defect the child has, doctors treat congenital heart defects with: Procedures using catheterization. Some children and adults now have their congenital heart defects repaired using catheterization techniques, which allow the repair to be done without surgically opening the chest and heart. In procedures that can be done using catheterization, the doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into a leg vein and guides it to the heart with the help of X-ray images. Some mild congenital heart defects, especially those found later in childhood or adulthood, can be treated with medications that help the heart work more efficiently. Drugs known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta blockers and medications that cause fluid loss (diuretics) can help ease stress on the heart by lowering blood pressure, heart rate and the amount of fluid in the chest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Tapv-575px.jpg

The risk of preeclampsia is higher for very young pregnant women as well as pregnant women older than 35. Black women have a higher risk of developing preeclampsia than women of other races. Having babies less than two years or more than 10 years apart leads to a higher risk of preeclampsia. Having certain conditions before one become pregnant such as chronic high blood pressure, migraines, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, a tendency to develop blood clots, or lupus increases the risk of preeclampsia.","To diagnose preeclampsia, one has to have high blood pressure and one or more of the following complications after the 20th week of pregnancy: Previously, preeclampsia was only diagnosed if high blood pressure and protein in the urine were present.

Although the liver has a great capacity for regeneration, constant exposure to toxic substances can cause serious, sometimes irreversible harm. Heavy drinking over many years can lead to alcoholic hepatitis inflammation in the liver due to alcohol, which can lead to liver failure. Some herbs considered dangerous to the liver include aloe vera, black cohosh, cascara, chaparral, comfrey, kava and ephedra.","Factors that may increase the risk of toxic hepatitis include Taking over-the-counter pain relievers or certain prescription drugs. Taking a medication or over-the-counter pain reliever that carries a risk of liver damage increases the risk of toxic hepatitis. Chronic infection with a hepatitis virus (hepatitis B, hepatitis C or one of the other extremely rare hepatitis viruses that may persist in the body) makes the liver more vulnerable. Drinking alcohol while taking medications or certain herbal supplements increases the risk of toxicity. Because women seem to metabolize certain toxins more slowly than men do, their livers are exposed to higher blood concentrations of harmful substances for a longer time.

One can control or treat a number of factors including certain health conditions and lifestyle choices that increase the risk of a stroke. Having one or more of these risk factors doesn't mean one will have a stroke, but the risk increases if one has two or more of them. But as women age, their risk of a stroke goes up. Sickle-shaped blood cells carry less oxygen and also tend to get stuck in artery walls, hampering blood flow to the brain. However, with proper treatment of sickle cell disease, one can lower the risk of a stroke. The risk of a stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings higher than 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).

Tricuspid valve regurgitation can be the result of a condition one is born with (congenital heart disease), or it can occur due to valve abnormalities caused by other conditions.","Tricuspid valve regurgitation can also occur with heart conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as left-sided heart failure that leads to right-sided heart failure. In this rare condition, the malformed tricuspid valve sits lower than normal in the right ventricle, and the tricuspid valve's leaflets are abnormally formed. Tricuspid valve regurgitation in children is usually caused by heart disease present at birth (congenital heart disease). The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The tricuspid valve which lies between the two chambers on the right side of the heart consists of three flaps of tissue called leaflets. The tricuspid valve may be damaged by an infection of the lining of the heart (infective endocarditis) that can involve heart valves. Experiencing trauma to the chest, such as in a car accident, can lead to tricuspid valve regurgitation. Rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat that can damage heart valves, including the tricuspid valve, leading to tricuspid valve regurgitation later in life. Some heart defects present at birth (congenital) may affect the tricuspid valve. Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder of connective tissue present at birth, is occasionally associated with tricuspid valve regurgitation.","Several factors can increase the risk of tricuspid valve regurgitation, including Infections such as infective endocarditis or rheumatic fever. Heart failure can increase the risk of developing tricuspid valve regurgitation. High blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension) can increase the risk of tricuspid valve regurgitation. Several forms of heart disease and heart valve disease may increase the risk of developing tricuspid valve regurgitation.

This condition produces multiple high-pressure, poorly coordinated contractions of the esophagus, usually after one swallow. Tumors or scar tissue, often caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause narrowing. Older adults with dentures and people who have difficulty chewing their food may be more likely to have a piece of food become lodged in the throat or esophagus. A thin area of narrowing in the lower esophagus can intermittently cause difficulty swallowing solid foods. Damage to esophageal tissues from stomach acid backing up into the esophagus can lead to spasm or scarring and narrowing of the lower esophagus. This condition, which may be related to a food allergy, is caused by an overpopulation of cells called eosinophils in the esophagus. Certain disorders such as multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson's disease can cause dysphagia.

Advances in blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery have improved blood sugar management and quality of life for children with type 1 diabetes.,"Insulin performs the critical job of moving sugar (glucose) from the bloodstream to the body's cells. Without enough insulin, sugar builds up in the child's bloodstream, where it can cause life-threatening complications if left untreated.","Risk factors for type 1 diabetes in children include Family history. Anyone with a parent or siblings with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition. Certain genes indicate an increased risk of type 1 diabetes. In the United States, type 1 diabetes is more common among white children of non-Hispanic descent than among children of other races.","There are several blood tests for type 1 diabetes in children: If blood sugar testing indicates diabetes, the doctor will likely recommend additional tests to distinguish between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes because treatment strategies differ by type. A blood sugar level of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or higher suggests diabetes.

With type 2 diabetes, the body either resists the effects of insulin a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into the cells or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.","In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.","However, one don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes. If one store fat mainly in the abdomen, one has a greater risk of type 2 diabetes than if one store fat elsewhere, such as in the hips and thighs. The risk of type 2 diabetes rises if one is a man with a waist circumference above 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) or a woman with a waist that's greater than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters). The less active one is, the greater the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races including black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian-American people are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white people are. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as one get older, especially after age 45. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes. If one developed gestational diabetes when one were pregnant, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases. If one gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), one is also at risk of type 2 diabetes. For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity increases the risk of diabetes.","Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed using the: If the A1C test isn't available, or if one has certain conditions such as an uncommon form of hemoglobin (known as a hemoglobin variant) that interfere with A1C test, the doctor may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes: Fasting blood sugar test. If the fasting blood sugar is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, one has diabetes. Screening is also recommended for people who are under 45 and overweight if there are other heart disease or diabetes risk factors present, such as a sedentary lifestyle, a family history of type 2 diabetes, a personal history of gestational diabetes or blood pressure above 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In addition to the A1C test, the doctor will measure the blood pressure and take blood and urine samples periodically to check the cholesterol levels, thyroid function, liver function and kidney function.

The male urinary system which includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra is responsible for removing waste from the body through urine. Certain drinks, foods and medications may act as diuretics stimulating the bladder and increasing the volume of urine. Infections can irritate the bladder, causing one to have strong urges to urinate, and sometimes incontinence. Vaginal delivery can weaken muscles needed for bladder control and also damage bladder nerves and supportive tissue, leading to a dropped (prolapsed) pelvic floor. With prolapse, the bladder, uterus, rectum or small intestine can get pushed down from the usual position and protrude into the vagina. After menopause women produce less estrogen, a hormone that helps keep the lining of the bladder and urethra healthy. In women, the bladder and uterus are supported by many of the same muscles and ligaments. Any surgery that involves a woman's reproductive system, including removal of the uterus, may damage the supporting pelvic floor muscles, which can lead to incontinence. Especially in older men, incontinence often stems from enlargement of the prostate gland, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia. A tumor anywhere along the urinary tract can block the normal flow of urine, leading to overflow incontinence. Urinary stones hard, stone-like masses that form in the bladder sometimes cause urine leakage.","Factors that increase the risk of developing urinary incontinence include Gender. However, men with prostate gland problems are at increased risk of urge and overflow incontinence. Extra weight increases pressure on the bladder and surrounding muscles, which weakens them and allows urine to leak out when one cough or sneeze. If a close family member has urinary incontinence, especially urge incontinence, the risk of developing the condition is higher.","It's important to determine the type of urinary incontinence that one has, and the symptoms often tell the doctor which type one has.

These conditions include the wear and tear associated with aging, high blood pressure, abnormal aging of blood vessels (atherosclerosis), diabetes, and brain hemorrhage.","In general, the risk factors for vascular dementia are the same as those for heart disease and stroke. If one has had a heart attack, one may be at increased risk of having blood vessel problems in the brain. The brain damage that occurs with a stroke or a ministroke (transient ischemic attack) may increase the risk of developing dementia. Atherosclerosis can increase the risk of vascular dementia by reducing the flow of blood that nourishes the brain. Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad cholesterol, are associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia. Damage in brain blood vessels can increase the risk of stroke and vascular dementia. Smoking directly damages the blood vessels, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and other circulatory diseases, including vascular dementia. Being overweight is a well-known risk factor for vascular diseases in general, and therefore, presumably increases the risk of vascular dementia.

Vascular rings,https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vascular-rings/cdc-20389579,,,,,"The child's doctor may initially suspect a problem because he or she hears a heart murmur during a routine exam. Most heart murmurs are innocent, meaning that there is no heart defect and the murmur isn't dangerous to the child's health. Some murmurs, however, may mean blood is flowing through the child's heart abnormally because he or she has a heart defect. If it's possible the child has a heart defect, the doctor or the child's doctor may order several tests to see if the child has a heart problem. The child's doctor may use a regular echocardiogram to diagnose a congenital heart defect after the child has been born. In this noninvasive test, the child's doctor performs an ultrasound to produce images of the heart. An echocardiogram allows the doctor to see the child's heart in motion and to identify abnormalities in the heart muscle and valves. In this test, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel at the baby's groin and guided through it into the heart. Catheterization is sometimes necessary because it may give the child's doctor a much more detailed view of the child's heart defect than an echocardiogram. This test allows the doctor to see if the child has a heart defect before he or she is born, allowing the doctor to better plan treatment. This noninvasive test records the electrical activity of the child's heart and can help diagnose heart defects or rhythm problems. The child may have a chest X-ray to see if the heart is enlarged, or if the lungs have extra blood or other fluid in them.","A congenital heart defect may have no long-term effect on the child's health in some instances, such defects can safely go untreated. Depending on the type of heart defect the child has, doctors treat congenital heart defects with: Procedures using catheterization. Some children and adults now have their congenital heart defects repaired using catheterization techniques, which allow the repair to be done without surgically opening the chest and heart. In procedures that can be done using catheterization, the doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) into a leg vein and guides it to the heart with the help of X-ray images. Some mild congenital heart defects, especially those found later in childhood or adulthood, can be treated with medications that help the heart work more efficiently. Drugs known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta blockers and medications that cause fluid loss (diuretics) can help ease stress on the heart by lowering blood pressure, heart rate and the amount of fluid in the chest.",,,Vascular system,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dust, smog, secondhand smoke or strong odors, such as perfumes, can trigger nonallergic rhinitis. A common cause of nonallergic rhinitis is a viral infection a cold or the flu, for example. Nonallergic rhinitis may occur when one eat, especially when eating hot or spicy foods. Drinking alcoholic beverages also may cause the membranes inside the nose to swell, leading to nasal congestion. Hormonal changes due to pregnancy, menstruation, oral contraceptive use or other hormonal condition such as hypothyroidism may cause nonallergic rhinitis. Lying on the back at night while one sleep can cause nonallergic rhinitis, as can obstructive sleep apnea or acid reflux.","If one is exposed to smog, exhaust fumes or tobacco smoke to name a few one may be at increased risk of developing nonallergic rhinitis. Unlike allergic rhinitis, which usually occurs before age 20, often in childhood, nonallergic rhinitis occurs after age 20 in most people. Using over-the-counter decongestant nasal drops or sprays (Afrin, Dristan, others) for more than a few days can actually cause more-severe nasal congestion when the decongestant wears off, often called rebound congestion.","The doctor is likely to conclude the symptoms are caused by nonallergic rhinitis if one has nasal congestion, a runny nose or postnasal drip, and tests for other conditions don't reveal an underlying cause such as allergies or a sinus problem. The only way to be sure rhinitis isn't caused by allergies is through allergy testing, which may involve skin or blood tests. If the doctor suspects a sinus problem may be causing the symptoms, one may need an imaging test to view the sinuses. To find out whether the symptoms might be caused by a certain allergen, the skin is pricked and exposed to small amounts of common airborne allergens, such as dust mites, mold, pollen, cat and dog dander. A blood test can measure the immune system's response to common allergens by measuring the amount of certain antibodies in the bloodstream, known as immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies.","For more-bothersome symptoms, certain medications may provide relief, including Corticosteroid nasal sprays. If the symptoms aren't easily controlled by decongestants or antihistamines, the doctor may suggest a nonprescription corticosteroid nasal spray, such as fluticasone (Flonase) or triamcinolone (Nasacort). Over-the-counter oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra) and loratadine (Claritin), typically don't work nearly as well for nonallergic rhinitis as they do for allergic rhinitis. While oral antihistamines don't seem to help nonallergic rhinitis, nasal sprays containing an antihistamine may reduce symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis. Available over-the-counter or by prescription, examples include pseudoephedrine-containing drugs (Sudafed) and phenylephrine (Afrin, Neo-Synephrine, others).","Use a specially designed squeeze bottle, such as the one included in saline kits, bulb syringe or neti pot to irrigate the nasal passages. This home remedy, called nasal lavage, can help keep the nose free of irritants. To prevent infection, use water that's distilled, sterile, previously boiled and cooled, or filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller to make up the irrigation solution.
